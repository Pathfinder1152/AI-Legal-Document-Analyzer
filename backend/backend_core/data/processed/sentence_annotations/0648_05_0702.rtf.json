He submits that it could not properly conclude that the Claimant reasonably believed that the seventh principle would be likely to be infringed without appreciating what that principle obliged an employer to do.  And that in turn meant that the Claimant had to be aware of these principles of interpretation and have had to have weighed them up when determining whether the information tended to show a likely breach or not.  It was an error, he said, for the Tribunal to suppose that the fact that the Claimant was able to break security was of itself sufficient to demonstrate that the security measures were inadequate and might involve a breach of the seventh principle.  The first point to note about this argument is that, as Mr Chaudhuri fairly says, the provision in part 2 of schedule 1 was not referred to the Employment Tribunal at all.  Mr Chaudhuri says that a similar argument was advanced but not in as precise a way as he is now formulating the matter before us.  But it seems to us that the following well-known authorities, such as Kumchyk v Derby County Council [1978] ICR 116, it would not be fair to permit this argument to be developed in this way for the first time before us.
