      "INTRODUC TION  \n",
      "1. This is the saddest of cases illustrating the desperate and lasting damage that can be \n",
      "done to children when their parents separate.  \n",
      "2. The case involves three children all aged under 12 – X (now aged 12 years, Y (now \n",
      "aged 10 years 1 month) and Z (now ag ed 8 years 4 months). It is beyond doubt that all \n",
      "three children have been caused persistent and significant harm as a direct result of \n",
      "the actions of both parents, separately and jointly, arising from the discord between \n",
      "the parents. Whether the harm caus ed to the children is irreparable remains to be seen. \n",
      "It is also an extraordinary and highly unusual case in which a father who has been \n",
      "found to have significantly alienated his children from their mother over several \n",
      "years, suddenly and completely unexpe ctedly changed position part way through the \n",
      "final hearing and now agrees to the children transferring to live with their mother. Dr \n",
      "Mark Berelowitz, the expert child and adolescent psychiatrist jointly instructed in the \n",
      "case, described this as one of the most intriguing and difficult changes he has come \n",
      "across. I agree.  \n",
      "3. The children’s parents are F and M who were previously married but are now \n",
      "divorced. M has recently remarried to Mr M who has a 5 year old daughter, VM. F is \n",
      "now 45 and M is now 43. They share parental responsibility for the children who have \n",
      "lived solely with F since August 2018.  \n",
      "RELEVANT BACKGROUND HISTORY  \n",
      "4. The case has a very long and complex history, including various types of dispute \n",
      "between the parents that have now been ongoing for s everal years. For the purposes of \n",
      "the current issues that I have to decide, the salient and relevant background facts are \n",
      "these.  \n",
      "5. On 16 February 2009 X was born and in July 2009 the parents married. On 26 \n",
      "January 2011 Y was born, and on 3 October 2012 Z was  born.  \n",
      "6. The children have been subject to court proceedings since March 2015. This is the \n",
      "fourth final hearing in the matter. The children are part of an extended and supportive \n",
      "maternal blended family which appears generally to have managed marital separat ion \n",
      "well and constructively, save in the case of these parents.  \n",
      "The first legal proceedings  \n",
      "7. The first set of legal proceedings were commenced by F on 28 March 2015. These led \n",
      "to a final order for a shared care arrangement being made on 30 March 2016.  \n",
      "8. In A ugust 2015 the parents separated following allegations by M against F. These \n",
      "allegations led to him being excluded from the family home, although he was later \n",
      "acquitted in the criminal proceedings.  ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH \n",

      " \n",
      " The second legal proceedings  \n",
      "9. The second set of legal proce edings were commenced by F on 6 September 2016. \n",
      "These led to the suspension of the shared care order and to supervised contact, and \n",
      "concluded at a final hearing on 16 March 2017 with a view to returning to the \n",
      "previous shared care order over a period of si x months. These proceedings concluded \n",
      "at a final hearing on 22 May 2018 with shared care arrangements to remain in place. \n",
      "A s91(14) order was also made for two years.  \n",
      "The third legal proceedings  \n",
      "10. In August 2018 an incident occurred in Cornwall (“the Cornwal l incident”) whereby \n",
      "M was under the influence of alcohol whilst caring for the children. This led to the \n",
      "involvement of police and the local authority, and the children were removed from \n",
      "M’s care. The shared care arrangement ceased and the children began living with F \n",
      "and stopped having contact with M. It is beyond doubt that the Cornwall incident has \n",
      "played or appears to have played such a significant part in these children’s \n",
      "understanding and narrative about their mother.  \n",
      "11. On 6 November 2018 F applied to vary the shared care order. Although his \n",
      "application was refused, that decision was subsequently overturned on appeal and F’s \n",
      "application was allowed by MacDonald J on 16 November 2018. At that hearing the \n",
      "children were joined as parties under r16.4 and th e case was listed for further hearing.  \n",
      "12. On 13 December 2018 the case came before Newton J and various case management \n",
      "directions were made, including provision for applications to be made for expert \n",
      "evidence. On 25 January 2019 the court granted the guardian’s Part 25 application for \n",
      "there to be a psychological assessment of the family by Dr Martinez.  \n",
      "13. On 18 February 2019 the local authority confirmed that they had now completed \n",
      "parenting assessments and would be closing their file.  \n",
      "14. On 9 April 2019 fin al judgment was given in the matrimonial finance proceedings. \n",
      "Some of her conclusions and findings bear repetition here because they are of direct \n",
      "relevance to the matters and issues that have been raised in these proceedings relating \n",
      "to the children.  \n",
      "15. Part of the matrimonial finance judgment at paragraph 95 dealt with M’s allegations \n",
      "that – \n",
      "F is intent on destroying her and has done hitherto all in his \n",
      "power to achieve that by way of his constant complaints to \n",
      "outside agencies.  \n",
      "16. In respect of that part of M’ s case, the judge said – \n",
      "Her case is he has lost her clients, reported two of her staff to \n",
      "the police, reported her and her family numerous times to the \n",

      "Computer Misuse Act 1990. MGM and her husband, Mr MGM, were also charged \n",
      "with the same offences.  \n",
      "18. At paragraphs 112 and 113 of the matrimonial finance judg ment, the judge concluded \n",
      "that F – \n",
      "…is a man determined to remain in litigation with the Wife at \n",
      "all costs and he tries to make her life as difficult as possible. I \n",
      "have formed the impression his actions are all consuming for \n",
      "him but also that he has lost sight of the bigger picture. \n",
      "Whatever the rights and wrongs of the computer charge, and I \n",
      "have no idea of what evidence there is to support it, and whilst \n",

      "prosecution is likely to have a significant impact on her earning \n",
      "capacity in the short and the long term…  \n",
      "19. At paragraph 177 the judge concluded that – \n",
      "In my view this is actually a very straightforward case if one \n",
      "leaves aside the complexities the Husband has sought to bring \n",
      "into it, either deliberately, or in my view more likely, because \n",
      "he is unable to bring himself to accept the reality of the \n",
      "situation.  \n",
      "20. And at paragraph 179 the judge went on – \n",
      "The difficulty for the Husband is he is simply unabl e to accept \n",
      "any responsibility for the situation the family found itself in. He \n",
      "is completely blinkered as to his role in this and seeks to put the \n",
      "blame entirely on the Wife. His case has always been that I am \n",
      "to look at what he has put into the family in  isolation, but not \n",
      "whether that was enough in light of their outgoings, or indeed \n",
      "what he has taken out. His sense of injustice in what has \n",
      "happened is entirely dependent on that scenario in his own \n",
      "mind. The sad reality is these parties played an equal p art in \n",
      "their financial downfall…  \n",

      " 22. In May 2019 M, MGM and Mr MGM were notified by the CPS that the criminal case \n",
      "against them was to be discontinued. The reason  provided by the CPS was that there \n",
      "was not enough evidence to support a realistic prospect of conviction.  \n",
      "23. At an interim hearing on 14 June 2019 an order was made by consent that the children \n",
      "should live with F. Various recitals were made as to interim con tact. The parties \n",
      "agreed that enquiries were to be made of family therapists to undertake the family \n",
      "therapy work as recommended by Dr Martinez. The case was timetabled through to a \n",
      "final hearing in December 2019.  \n",
      "24. On 10 July 2019 the court refused M’s appl ication to instruct the Family Separation \n",
      "Clinic but indicated that a therapist, B, should undertake the therapeutic work with the \n",
      "family that had been recommended by Dr Martinez.  \n",
      "25. At the next hearing on 23 Sept 2019 it was planned to review the progress of  B’s \n",
      "work with the family. F said the therapeutic work was progressing satisfactorily, but \n",
      "that further work was needed to enable further progress to be made. However, M said \n",
      "no real progress was being made with the therapeutic work, that contact was not \n",
      "progressing or being promoted, and she raised concerns about the way in which B was \n",
      "carrying out her work with the family. The court concluded that B lacked the \n",
      "necessary expertise to undertake the work recommended by Dr Martinez and agreed \n",
      "that a further p rofessional would need to assess and work with the family. MGM was \n",
      "joined as a party.  \n",
      "26. On 26 September 2019 the court ordered that the Family Separation Clinic, on M’s \n",
      "application, should be instructed to undertake an assessment and to carry out \n",
      "therapeutic  work with the family. The Family Separation Clinic was directed to \n",
      "provide a report about progress by 5 December 2019. However, by 12 November \n",
      "2019 it had become clear that the Family Separation Clinic was conflicted because it \n",
      "had previously undertaken s ome work on the case with MGM earlier in 2019. They \n",
      "therefore formally withdrew from the case.  \n",
      "27. On 19 November 2019 the court ordered the instruction of Dr Berelowitz in place of \n",
      "the Family Separation Clinic. He was to provide his report by 30 March 2020. I t was \n",
      "also agreed that the guardian would convene a family meeting with members of both \n",
      "the maternal and paternal extended families about the issue of progressing contact \n",
      "between the children and members of the maternal family. That meeting took place on \n",
      "16 January 2020 although M was not present; F and members of the extended \n",
      "maternal and paternal families were present. The meeting failed to achieve any \n",
      "agreement about how contact could progress between the children and the extended \n",
      "maternal family.  \n",
      "28. On 3 A pril 2020 the case was heard again. Dr Berelowitz’s report was now available \n",
      "and highlighted his serious concerns for the children, including the concern that \n",
      "neither of the parents was able to promote a relationship between the children and the \n",
      "other pare nt. Dr Berelowitz is a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at the \n",
      "Royal Free Hospital. He had been instructed to undertake an holistic assessment as to \n",
      "why the children are refusing contact with M and MGM. He was invited to carry out \n",
      "assessment and therapy as he saw fit. Dr Berelowitz summarised the historical \n",
      "positions taken by both parents, as well as the opinions of various professionals who ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH \n",
      "COURT JUDGE  \n",
      "Approved Judgment   \n",
      " \n",
      " have worked with the family. He carried out various interviews with family members \n",
      "including the parents,  children and MGM.  \n",
      "29. At that stage Dr Berelowitz concluded that all of the children were clear that F’s \n",
      "attitude was that he would support contact if they wanted it, but not that he was \n",
      "actively trying to promote it. Dr Berelowitz’s view at that stage was t hat the children \n",
      "had not been given the impression by F that he thought that contact is firmly in their \n",
      "interests, and overall they had a shared narrative with F about how they came to be \n",
      "where they are.  \n",
      "30. Dr Berelowitz described this as a case involving a l evel of discord and suspicion that \n",
      "is striking even by the unusual standards of contested family law proceedings. He \n",
      "recommended a fact -finding hearing to consider the allegations that were made to him \n",
      "by both parents during his meetings with them. A fact -finding hearing was therefore \n",
      "listed for 24 August 2020.  \n",
      "31. In April 2020 the guardian began regular video calls with the parents with a view to \n",
      "progressing the issue of contact. At that stage M’s last contact with the children had \n",
      "been in August 2018, almos t two years previously. The guardian had consistently \n",
      "made it clear to the parents that the video calls were entirely voluntary, were not \n",
      "directed by the court and could be stopped at any time should either parent wish. The \n",
      "guardian noted that at times the  calls were extremely difficult and progress had often \n",
      "been slow due to the very evident levels of hostility and suspicion that both parents \n",
      "continued to exhibit towards one another. Both parents told the guardian at various \n",
      "times that they felt bullied an d intimidated by the other parent, and each regarded \n",
      "themselves as a victim of domestic abuse by the other. However, the guardian \n",
      "reported to the hearing on 4 August 2020 that notwithstanding these concerns, both \n",
      "parents had continued to engage with him ov er the past few months with a view to \n",
      "progressing the issue of contact.  \n",
      "32. Since April 2020 some small progress with contact was therefore made, although at \n",
      "times it appeared to the guardian as somewhat slow and frustrating. However, efforts \n",
      "to reintroduce M’ s contact appeared to have started very well and good progress was \n",
      "made initially with an exchange of letters and the more recent video messages.  \n",
      "33. On 26 June 2020 the guardian discussed with both parents starting direct contact at \n",
      "the Town B Centre. This is  a contact services facilitator commissioned by CAFCASS \n",
      "in private law and r16.4 cases to facilitate contact where it is deemed necessary to \n",
      "reintroduce contact with the non -resident parent. In this case the guardian had \n",
      "commissioned six sessions in which the Town B Centre would try to work with the \n",
      "children and the parents to overcome any fears they may have about seeing M. The \n",
      "aim of this work was to reduce anxiety for the children.  \n",
      "The fact -finding hearing  \n",
      "34. I conducted a five day fact -finding hearing in p erson in August 2020 and heard \n",
      "evidence from both parents and various members of both extended families. At that \n",
      "hearing F represented himself, very ably, in person. I did not hear evidence from the \n",
      "guardian who, although being involved for two years at th at stage, had managed to \n",

      "before handing down judgment, I directed that contact should resume as quickly as \n",

      "36. The scope of the fact -finding hearing was limited to determining allegations made by \n",
      "both parents since May 2 018. In my judgment dated 30 September 2020 (“the fact -\n",

      " F deliberately lied about M and MGM having ‘knobbled’ a judge when talking to Q (a \n",

      " F has deliberately lied about the children having exhibited sexualised behaviour, \n",

      " F has damaged the children’s relationship with M.  \n",

      "THE CHIL DREN’S WISHES AND FEELINGS  \n",
      "144. Dr Berelowitz describes each of the children as expressing different wishes and \n",

      "greatly affects their ascertainable wishes and feelings. Thus, t he more the child is \n",
      "alienated, the less their ascertainable wishes and feelings should be taken at face \n",

      "with whom they reside.  \n",
      "145. The guardian has extensively consulted the children and sought their views about their \n",

      "therefore likely that the children's view of M is still being heavily influenced by F. \n",
      "The guardian says that the children’s wishes a nd feelings are not formed in a vacuum, \n",
      "and a question therefore arises as to how much weight should be given to their views. \n",
      "He says – \n",
      "I respect and acknowledge the views expressed by the children, \n",
      "but these views must be seen in the context of their prev ious \n",
      "experiences and the fact that they have been significantly \n",
      "alienated against their mother.  \n",
      "146. The guardian is concerned that if decision -making is led by the children's wishes \n",
      "alone, which is largely what F said he was doing and following between August 2018 \n",
      "and September 2020, they will continue to suffer psychological harm due to alienation \n",
      "from M, which consequently risks further mental health problems as they grow older.  \n",
      "147. That analysis is endorsed by Dr Berelowitz, and I accept their combined evidence  on \n",
      "this point about how much weight should be attached to the wishes and feelings of \n",
      "alienated children in general, and to these children in particular. Thus the approach I \n",
      "have taken in this case is that the more the child is alienated, the less I should  take \n",
      "their ascertainable wishes and feelings at face value, and the more I need to apply a \n",
      "comprehensive and holistic approach to helping them with their alienation.  \n",
      "X \n",
      "148. The guardian describes X as having been consistent and very vocal about wanting to \n",

      "spending time with M and saying that she does not want to live with her. She has \n",
      "persistently and consistently said that she did not want to see M and the maternal \n",
      "family. She feels frustrated that the guardian is not listening to her as she is clear \n",
      "about her wishes. She is very rigid in her thinking, according to the guardian, and \n",
      "would not accept anything negative being said about F, whereas by contrast she is \n",
      "very negative a bout M, describing her as a bully, and says she does not deserve the \n",
      "title ‘mum’. The guardian’s conclusion is that X appears to be aligned to F as a way of \n",
      "protecting herself from the trauma of what happened in the past, and her fears are then \n",
      "compounded by the alienation she has experienced. X does not accept that F \n",
      "contributed to the harm that the children suffered by alienating them against M and \n",
      "her family. Dr Berelowitz advises that it is important to recognise that she is the most \n",
      "alienated, and that  it will be hardest of all for her to move on from the feelings of \n",
      "alienation. He describes her having ended up with entrenched negative views about \n",

      "this, to herself and a lso to other people, hence his concern about the work with U. He \n",

      "Firstly she does not feel safe around her. Sec ondly M lies a lot about X’s memories \n",
      "and tries to hide what happened. Thirdly, she doesn't want to see M because she \n",
      "knows the days will expand and go for longer until she has to live with her. She says \n",
      "she is not comfortable staying overnight with M. Fou rthly she feels she is being \n",
      "treated exactly the same as Y and Z but they're not the same they are different people \n",
      "with different thoughts. She said she does not want to see M but her brother and sister \n",
      "do. Finally, she says she really does not like Mr M and she does not feel safe around \n",
      "him. She said he scares her. She said she feels that Mr M and VM are just people who \n",
      "live with M and have no relation to her. She says that she should not be forced to see \n",
      "M as she feels worried and scared, but that if she  had a choice about seeing her now, \n",
      "maybe she will want to see her in the future.  \n",
      "151. Dr Berelowitz has considered the Cafcass guidance on parental alienation and advises \n",
      "that it is vital to look at the whole picture and also the severity of the alienation. H e \n",
      "describes X as being the child who was most strongly affected at the time by M’s \n",
      "health issues and who is the child who is most alienated. He describes her as \n",
      "challenging and aggressive to M and seems to believe that she needs one parent only. \n",
      "She has al so at times set herself up as the protector of the younger children and/or F. \n",
      "Furthermore, Dr Berelowitz notes the unfortunate consequence for X of taking such \n",
      "an entrenched position; in other words she pays a price for taking that position which \n",
      "means she  has less time with her siblings, but she still cannot readily change.  \n",
      "Y \n",
      "152. When the guardian first started working with Y she did not want to see M and \n",
      "expressed strong views against spending time with the maternal family. However she \n",
      "was the first to take significant steps to resuming contact with M, including writing \n",
      "letters, recording videos, and talking on video. The guardian describes Y as appearing \n",
      "to be ‘the shining light’ in leading the way to resuming contact with M. She has \n",
      "always been the most ame nable to resuming contact, and the guardian was not \n",
      "surprised that she was the first one of the children to engage in a video call with M \n",

      " Z \n",
      "155. The guardian describes Z as a child who is very confused about everything that has \n",
      "happened to him and what is now happening. When the guardian talked to Z about his \n",
      "views about his living arrangements, he  expressed – as he always has done – that he \n",
      "wants to live with F and doesn't want to see M. He alleged that M was bargaining by \n",
      "allowing the children their screens and phones and threatening to take them away if \n",
      "they did not do what she wants. He was very  negative about M stating that if there \n",
      "was one irritating person who had ruined his life, it was her. Yet at the same time, he \n",
      "has said that while he does not want to see M, he also said that he wants to help her.  \n",
      "156. Dr Berelowitz is of the opinion that Z fa lls between X and Y in terms of the extent to \n",
      "which he is or is not alienated from M. There is a lack of congruence between what Z \n",
      "says and what he does. Z’s expressed views are clear: he does not want to live with or \n",
      "spend time with M. However, his behavi our when he is with her seems different to \n",
      "what he tells professionals. He appears to enjoy spending time with her and has \n",
      "attended every session as ordered by the court, albeit with some difficult handovers.  \n",
      "157. The guardian’s view is that this indicates tha t Z is struggling with loyalty, conflict and \n",
      "wanting to please F, a situation compounded by the fact that the children were \n",
      "alienated against M which involved psychological manipulation. Dr Berelowitz \n",
      "describes Z’s language  as putting him closer to X, but his behaviour  puts him closer to \n",

      "158. Both the guardian and Dr Berelowitz  agree that, optimally, what all three children \n",
      "need is to have a rich and full relationship with both parents. All three children also \n",
      "need to feel safe when in the care of their parents. For the period they have been in the \n",
      "care of F there have not been any substantiated concerns about their physical safety. \n",
      "As I have already identified, Y and Z have a skin condition and it is critical that they \n",
      "are given appropriate support to look after their skin.  \n",
      "159. In considering the children’s needs, the guardian relies on the professional definition \n",
      "of resilience as being the ability to persevere and thrive in the face of exposure to \n",
      "adverse situations. They are a sibling group who very much love each other, but th ey \n",
      "are also individuals with different personalities. And although by and large they were \n",
      "exposed to the same to the same or similar traumatic events in 2016 and 2018, their \n",
      "levels of resilience are different. Dr Berelowitz explained that in this situation  where \n",
      "there are three children who have been alienated from their mother, they will tend not \n",
      "to follow the same paths. He said that each makes their own adjustments, and for each \n",
      "of them a different narrative exists. That can continue even if their relati onship with \n",
      "the alienated parent, in this case M, improves. He advised strongly that it is therefore \n",
      "important to look at the children as individuals, and said it would be a mistake to treat \n",
      "them as a ‘job lot’. He cautioned against assuming that they are all the same.   \n",
      "160. Despite the trauma that the children have suffered as a result of M being intoxicated \n",
      "with alcohol, poor mental health and neglecting their needs in August 2018, it is clear \n",
      "that Y and Z have now been able to take significant steps towards rebuilding their ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH \n",

      " relationship with M, including prior to this hearing an extended stay in contact for \n",
      "five nights. The guardian’s view is that this contact appears to have gone largely well.  \n",
      "161. However, Dr Berelowitz cautioned that the success in contact for  Y and Z is only \n",
      "relatively recent. He said the discord in the parents causes contact to hang by a thread. \n",
      "He advised that if the discord persists and there remains an ‘open psychological \n",
      "wound’ for the children, then the situation will continue to remain very fragile. While \n",
      "Y is relatively settled, the situation with Z fluctuates and is fragile, and with X, it is \n",
      "exceptionally fragile and also worrying. Dr Berelowitz’s opinion is that this is to be \n",
      "expected given the finding of alienation.  \n",
      "162. Dr Berelowitz al so advised during any period of protective separation from F the \n",
      "children will need not to have too many contacts in order to help them settle.  \n",
      "163. Both Dr Berelowitz and the guardian have analysed X’s needs very carefully. She is \n",
      "extremely entrenched in refu sing contact with M. This could be as a result of the \n",
      "previous harm caused to her and the younger children by M which should not be \n",
      "minimised. However, it is also clear that the parental alienation caused by F is an \n",
      "ongoing significant risk factor that is impacting on her relationship with M.  \n",
      "164. Dr Berelowitz describes X as being somewhat stuck. The description of M that she \n",
      "gave to U, as well as her demonstrated ongoing uncertainty about contact with M, \n",
      "gives real cause for concern. He considers that X will struggle to rebuild her \n",
      "relationship with M while her entrenched negative views about M and her idealisation \n",
      "of F persist. He frankly explained that there is little agreement in his field about \n",
      "whether or not psychological interventions with a child can re verse or undo X’s \n",
      "current state of mind.  \n",
      "165. If there is no transfer of residence, then it is crucial that X receives the right help, but \n",
      "it is also very important to avoid a process that reinforces the status quo which would \n",
      "be contrary to her interests. It m ight be that the passage of time with increasingly \n",
      "successful contact with M, including staying contact, could provide sufficient positive \n",
      "experiences such that X’s uncertainty would diminish over time. F might be able, with \n",
      "the help of a suitable therapis t, to give X a more comprehensive message about how \n",
      "his own behaviour impacted upon the evolution of her feelings about M. The same \n",
      "could apply to M. So there may be scope for X and the parents to have a modified \n",
      "form of systemic therapy, in which X and F,  and X and M, have joint sessions with \n",
      "the same therapist.  \n",
      "166. In terms of possible therapeutic work for X in the future, Dr Berelowitz said that the \n",
      "challenge is to identify the purpose  of the therapy. He said that what X needs is a clear \n",
      "expression by F tha t it is the conduct of the adults  that has made things harder for her, \n",
      "and his unwavering commitment must be to help get her to understand that point. He \n",
      "also advised that for any shared care arrangement to work, F needs to convey to X \n",
      "that he knows she is  apprehensive because  of him for which he is sorry and that he \n",
      "wants to do whatever he can to help her. He said it is clear that F has the capacity to \n",
      "influence the children a very great deal and that F needs to acknowledge his power \n",
      "and influence.  \n",
      "167. Dr Ber elowitz confirmed in evidence that in this type of very complex and \n",

      "light of their expressed wishes and feelings, they will experience trauma and dis tress. \n",
      "They will also inevitably miss F to whom they are very closely attached. For X, it is \n",
      "likely that this will be very acute indeed, and things are likely to be very hard for her \n",
      "and M. M is likely to find X very variable.  \n",
      "170. He also advised that, becaus e the history of constructive working between the parents \n",
      "as well as that the improvement in contact for Y and Z is so recent, it is very difficult \n",
      "to predict the success of shared care in this case at this stage. He explained that most \n",
      "transfers of reside nce take place in the absence of successful contact. He explained \n",

      "171. In May 2019 Dr Martinez described the relationship between F and X as   follows – \n",
      "F sometimes struggled to keep his descriptions of affection and \n",
      "pleasure of his children moderate; for example, he said of X, \" \n",

      "X, such as saying, \" we'll say the same thing. We'll finish each \n",

      "an aligning of the child with his own character, rather tha n \n",

      "sister,\" which indicates that he is able to be balanced in his \n",
      "descript ions of her.  \n",
      "172. In evidence, Dr Berelowitz characterised this alignment and enmeshment as \n",
      "concerning; he said it demonstrates an inability by both X and F to separate from each \n",
      "other which leads him to feel concerned about how difficult it would be for them t o \n",
      "develop separate views from each other. While this may not have been deliberate or \n",
      "intentional behaviour on F’s part, Dr Berelowitz is also clear that things have not \n",
      "improved and are significantly worse now.  \n",
      "173. F asserts that he is doing his best to promot e contact and has been inspired by Dr \n",
      "Berelowitz’s first report to be more firm in pushing the children to see their mother. \n",
      "However, I accept the guardian's analysis that, while F may be genuinely trying to do \n",
      "his best to promote contact, it should not be  ignored that he either intentionally or \n",
      "unintentionally instilled in the children such a fear of their mother due to past events, \n",
      "that they initially were absolutely adamant they did not want to have contact with her \n",
      "or her wider family. The guardian’s vi ew is that F has exploited this to his advantage. \n",
      "I also accept that analysis, although it is impossible to reach any conclusion about F’s \n",
      "motivation or intention in this regard.  \n",
      "174. The guardian has plainly considered very carefully the risks to the children of having \n",
      "suffered alienation as I have found. He said this – \n",
      "Alienation of a child can be compared to a non -accidental \n",
      "injury of the mind and it raises significant concern about risk of \n",
      "harm. Alienation causes psychological harm to a child, which \n",
      "although  may not be too obvious compared to physical abuse, \n",
      "should still be treated as an abusive behaviour. It violates a \n",
      "child’s sense of self, their right to choose, their identity and \n",

      " 176. As discussed above, Dr Berelowitz highlighted that U’s note relating to 29 October \n",
      "2020 is a powerful and disconcerting example of the impact of parental alienation, not \n",
      "only on the child but also on the well intentioned professional network.  \n",
      "177. Dr Berelowitz wondered why in such a complicated case X was indeed even being \n",
      "supported by a vol unteer, to what ends, and what the boundaries are. He said that any \n",
      "person in whom X confides and who is not aware of the detail of the case is \n",
      "vulnerable to reinforcing the alienation.  \n",
      "178. Dr Berelowitz has considered ways in which the harm to the children t hat has already \n",
      "occurred could be ameliorated in the future. He said that unfortunately the level of \n",
      "mistrust in this case is so great that he does not think that the family can see any \n",
      "professional person with whom one of them has already had privileged c onversations. \n",
      "It is for that reason he does not think Dr D is an option for providing systemic family \n",

      "such that it seems unlikely that mediation or therapy for the parents together, with or \n",
      "without the children, is currently possible. That echoes the view that I expressed at an \n",
      "earlier stage in these proceedings. Dr Berelowitz says he would very much like to be \n",
      "wrong about this and that it would be wonderful if a suggestion of systemic therapy \n",
      "could be taken up. He says that the great thing about systemic therapy is that it is a \n",
      "blame -free approach which looks at ways of nudging people out of entrenched \n",
      "patterns. He says however that he just does not think these parents are t here yet. I \n",
      "agree.  \n",
      "179. X appears to have been severely affected by alienation, in that she is rejecting of M \n",
      "and the maternal family. The guardian agrees with Dr Berelowitz  that there is a risk of \n",
      "being diverted from the most significant factor that is causing X to reject M, namely \n",
      "the alienation caused by F, towards too great a focus on presenting ‘symptoms’ such \n",
      "as vomiting and the emotional distress that she is displaying . It is well documented \n",
      "that the children suffered previous harm in M’s care, including neglect of their basic \n",

      "from poor mental health in 2016 and 2018. That was confirmed in the local authority \n",

      "memories are distorted), but it is the harm caused by the established alienation that \n",

      "192. Dr D sets out clearly the nature of the concerns arising from the courts findings and \n",
      "his initial focus with F was on exploring those issues. Dr D describes much of F’s \n",
      "decision -making as having appeared to have stemmed from a wish to protect the \n",

      "197. It is clear that there has remained and continued to be an ongoing dispute between the \n",
      "parents about contact. As the guardian says, there have been countless other matters \n",
      "raised during these proceedings that have taken up considerable amounts of time and \n",
      "correspondence. One vivid example of this relates to X’s medical records which M \n",
      "previously tried to obtain, but was prevented from doing so by the GP surgery due to \n",
      "them being under the impression that she was not entitled to see them. Last year a \n",
      "Caldecott G uardian assessed X as being Gillick competent to decide who should see \n",

      "records have not been shared with anyone else and I have not seen them. The guardian \n",
      "confirms that he does not believe the notes contain a great deal of information that is \n",
      "not already known about, although he cannot say for certain. What is important, \n",
      "however, is that it is clear from the notes that the surgery was indeed told previously \n",
      "not to disclose information to M. In the guardian’s view it is also clear from the notes \n",
      "that M was again excluded from exercising her parental responsibility as F is the only \n",
      "parent listed on the form. This is a reflection of the previous findings made by the \n",

      "to be maintained, certainly once the involvement of the guardian and the court is at an \n",
      "end. There is a high risk, based on the history, that F will be unable to promote \n",

      "children. However, Dr Berelowitz also advised that sometimes the perfect solution for \n",
      "a child simply  cannot be attainable, and that seeking a good enough solution is the \n",
      "only realistic option.  \n",
      "232. That is ultimately why in this option, taking account of all the history and evidence \n",
      "that I have considered, the benefits do outweigh the negatives.  \n",
      "Option 4 – splitting the children so that Y and Z transfer to live with M, and X remains \n",
      "living with F  \n",
      "233. The benefit of this option would be that Y and Z, who are already now enjoying or \n",
      "appearing to enjoy quality contact with M, could continue to improve and restore t he \n",
      "relationship with her. Another benefit is that there is no evidence to suggest that M \n",
      "would not promote their contact with F and X, and so the court could be confident \n",
      "with this option that Y and Z would continue to have the opportunity to enjoy a \n",
      "relationship with him. Another benefit of this option would be that Y and Z could \n",
      "resume good quality relationships with their extended maternal family which have, as \n",
      "I have already found, been fractured and damaged by F. Another benefit of this \n",
      "option, which c annot be overlooked, is that it provokes less opportunity for X to \n",
      "undermine Y’s and Z’s relationships with M because she will get what she wants, \n",
      "namely to stay with F.  \n",
      "234. The obvious detriment of this option is that the children would be separated from each  \n",
      "other, and in all likelihood the impact of this on their sibling relationship would be \n",
      "damaged in the medium to longer term. This option also risks polarising the alliances \n",
      "within the family which is not in the children’s best interests. It is highly like ly that \n",
      "X’s relationships with M and the maternal extended family will remain damaged and \n",
      "fractured, if not indeed non -existent. There is a real risk that X never re -establishes \n",
      "her relationship with M. And there is a very real and significant risk that th is option \n",
      "would cause significant harm to all three children. All the concerns I have previously \n",
      "highlighted about F’s inability to promote contact would apply to X here. There is \n",
      "also a very real risk of the concern already expressed by the guardian and D r \n",
      "Berelowitz of the enmeshed and intense relationship between F and X continuing. \n",
      "This cannot be in X’s best interests because she needs to separate emotionally, as all \n",
      "children do, from her parents. The chance of this happening for X if she remains \n",
      "living  with F, particularly without her siblings, seems highly likely.  \n",
      "235. Having eliminated Option 1  and Option 2  as being unrealistic for these children at this \n",
      "stage in their lives, I have then weighed and balanced Option 3  and Option 4  against ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH \n",
      "COURT JUDGE  \n",
      "Approved Judgment   \n",
      " \n",
      " each other. This has been a difficult and finely balanced exercise. Until F’s dramatic \n",
      "and significant shift in position on Day 2 of the hearing, Option 4  was the option \n",
      "reluctantly favoured by the guardian and by Dr Berelowitz.  \n",
      "236. However as Dr Berelowitz h as said, F’s agreement shifts the balance sufficiently, \n",
      "such that the detriments of this option outweigh the benefits. I agree. Option 3  is not \n",
      "without its risks as already identified, particularly in the short term. However, I must \n",
      "also consider the mediu m and long -term situation for these children. Dr Berelowitz \n",
      "reiterated that F’s attitude is an important factor; the more F supports the plan the \n",
      "more likely a move to a more shared care arrangement in the future will be. However \n",
      "the less supportive F is, the more artificial the plan will be. He thinks F understands \n",
      "this. He said that in summary Y and Z are likely to settle with M. He said he expects \n",
      "they will be sad from time to time but they will settle, but they need to be protected \n",
      "from the undermining that could happen. However, he said one possible outcome \n",
      "which is challenging and sad is that Y and Z settle well, but that X becomes ever \n",
      "dependent on F and evermore isolated. He has considered whether it would be \n",
      "possible to transfer residence for Y and Z, but leave X in F’s care. He thinks this \n",
      "would leave X vulnerable.  \n",
      "237. However on the other hand if she also moves to live with them, she could disrupt \n",
      "everything; he says there are lots of questions about the pros and cons of moving X. If \n",
      "she moves and one  says to her that if it doesn't work then she can go back to F, then \n",
      "we are setting up a ‘hostage to fortune’ situation where she may undermine the plan in \n",
      "order to go back to F. At the time of meeting the guardian, Dr Berelowitz’s mind was \n",
      "not made up. Ho wever, he thought that splitting the children as a proposal would \n",
      "certainly safeguard Y and Z. He said in his opinion a lot still depends on F’s capacity \n",
      "to change. If this works well and he manages to change, this will be a magnet that \n",
      "draws X into a rela tionship with him and her siblings. However if it does not work F \n",
      "and X could become more isolated, she could move away and have nothing to do with \n",
      "M and the siblings. Dr Berelowitz cannot predict whether it will be one or the other. \n",
      "In his opinion a lot w ill also depend on how M proposes that it would work and would \n",
      "be managed if X was to move as well.  \n",
      "238. I find that, in all the circumstances, the risks of Option 4  are greater than the risks of \n",
      "Option 3  in terms of the likelihood of harm to the children in th e medium and short -\n",
      "term.  \n",
      "THE TRANSFER OF RESIDENCE  \n",
      "239. Dr Berelowitz was asked in terms to advise how any change of residence should be \n",
      "managed, including whether there should be a period of no contact between the \n",
      "children and F, and, if so, for how long and h ow contact should be re -introduced at \n",
      "the end of it. He was also asked to give his view as to what each of the children \n",
      "should be told about a change of residence. Finally he was asked to give his opinion, \n",
      "based on his previous assessment of them and the u pdating evidence with which he \n",
      "had been provided, how each child is likely to respond emotionally to a change of \n",
      "residence. Dr Berelowitz advised that this is an area for which there is little published \n",
      "evidence and about which there is little professional  discourse and so his opinions are \n",
      "offered very much with caution in mind. He observes that the usual practice is to \n",
      "transfer children without notice and from a neutral venue if at all possible. He said ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH \n",
      "COURT JUDGE  \n",
      "Approved Judgment   \n",
      " \n",
      " that where contact is already taking place, the conta ct should simply be extended and \n",
      "converted into residence. He said that telling children in advance that they are going \n",
      "to move increases the likelihood of a traumatic incident.  \n",
      "240. Dr Berelowitz advised that during and in the period immediately after the tra nsfer M \n",
      "will need support from a family therapist to help her with challenges from X. Steps \n",
      "are already underway to identify such a therapist.  \n",
      "241. In respect of what the children should be told, Dr Berelowitz said that the children \n",
      "need to be advised in terms  that the court has found that F has made it psychologically \n",
      "impossible for them to relax into a rich and full relationship with M. He said X and Z \n",
      "may also need to be told that the consequence of F’s approach has been that they will \n",
      "find it very difficult  to accept the judgment of the court.  \n",
      "242. Dr Berelowitz was asked how the children would each be likely to respond to an order \n",
      "for transfer of residence. He advised that there is no data available from any source on \n",
      "outcomes of change of residence. He could s peak anecdotally of the cases with which \n",
      "he has been involved, which he thinks are about 20, and he said that in all of those \n",
      "cases all of the children settled more readily than he feared they might. The one case \n",
      "where it did not work was a case in which h e had not been involved from the outset. \n",
      "That was a case of the most extreme alienation that he had come across where the \n",
      "child had no contact with their father for five years. In another case where he knows \n",
      "that the transfer did not work that was due to u ndermining by the other parent. In that \n",
      "case there were secret telephones and secret meetings at school and a phone was even \n",
      "found under the child’s pillow.  \n",
      "DECISION  \n",
      "243. For all the reasons analysed herein, and taking account of the children’s welfare as my \n",
      "paramount consideration, I have therefore concluded that Option 3  is the option that is \n",
      "in the children’s best interests and that the children should transfer to live with M as \n",
      "soon as possible.  \n",
      "244. I have therefore made the children subject of a child arrangem ents order whereby they \n",
      "shall live with M, with a period of protective separation of three months from F. At \n",
      "the time of writing, the transfer appears to have been effected smoothly and without \n",
      "major incident.  \n",
      "245. That is my judgment.  \n"

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "1. This is the saddest of cases illustrating the desperate and lasting damage that can be\n",
      "done to children when their parents separate.\n",
      "2. The case involves three children all aged under 12 – X (now aged 12 years, Y (now\n",
      "aged 10 years 1 month) and Z (now aged 8 years 4 months). It is beyond doubt that all\n",
      "three children have been caused persistent and significant harm as a direct result of\n",
      "the actions of both parents, separately and jointly, arising from the discord between\n",
      "the parents. Whether the harm caused to the children is irreparable remains to be seen.\n",
      "It is also an extraordinary and highly unusual case in which a father who has been\n",
      "found to have significantly alienated his children from their mother over several\n",
      "years, suddenly and completely unexpectedly changed position part way through the\n",
      "final hearing and now agrees to the children transferring to live with their mother. Dr\n",
      "Mark Berelowitz, the expert child and adolescent psychiatrist jointly instructed in the\n",
      "case, described this as one of the most intriguing and difficult changes he has come\n",
      "across. I agree.\n",
      "3. The children’s parents are F and M who were previously married but are now\n",
      "divorced. M has recently remarried to Mr M who has a 5 year old daughter, VM. F is\n",
      "now 45 and M is now 43. They share parental responsibility for the children who have\n",
      "lived solely with F since August 2018.\n",
      "RELEVANT BACKGROUND HISTORY\n",
      "4. The case has a very long and complex history, including various types of dispute\n",
      "between the parents that have now been ongoing for several years. For the purposes of\n",
      "the current issues that I have to decide, the salient and relevant background facts are\n",
      "these.\n",
      "5. On 16 February 2009 X was born and in July 2009 the parents married. On 26\n",
      "January 2011 Y was born, and on 3 October 2012 Z was born.\n",
      "6. The children have been subject to court proceedings since March 2015. This is the\n",
      "fourth final hearing in the matter. The children are part of an extended and supportive\n",
      "maternal blended family which appears generally to have managed marital separation\n",
      "well and constructively, save in the case of these parents.\n",
      "The first legal proceedings\n",
      "7. The first set of legal proceedings were commenced by F on 28 March 2015. These led\n",
      "to a final order for a shared care arrangement being made on 30 March 2016.\n",
      "8. In August 2015 the parents separated following allegations by M against F. These\n",
      "allegations led to him being excluded from the family home, although he was later\n",
      "acquitted in the criminal proceedings.\n",
      "ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH\n",
      "COURT JUDGE\n",
      "Approved Judgment\n",
      "The second legal proceedings\n",
      "9. The second set of legal proceedings were commenced by F on 6 September 2016.\n",
      "These led to the suspension of the shared care order and to supervised contact, and\n",
      "concluded at a final hearing on 16 March 2017 with a view to returning to the\n",
      "previous shared care order over a period of six months. These proceedings concluded\n",
      "at a final hearing on 22 May 2018 with shared care arrangements to remain in place.\n",
      "A s91(14) order was also made for two years.\n",
      "The third legal proceedings\n",
      "10. In August 2018 an incident occurred in Cornwall (“the Cornwall incident”) whereby\n",
      "M was under the influence of alcohol whilst caring for the children. This led to the\n",
      "involvement of police and the local authority, and the children were removed from\n",
      "M’s care. The shared care arrangement ceased and the children began living with F\n",
      "and stopped having contact with M. It is beyond doubt that the Cornwall incident has\n",
      "played or appears to have played such a significant part in these children’s\n",
      "understanding and narrative about their mother.\n",
      "11. On 6 November 2018 F applied to vary the shared care order. Although his\n",
      "application was refused, that decision was subsequently overturned on appeal and F’s\n",
      "application was allowed by MacDonald J on 16 November 2018. At that hearing the\n",
      "children were joined as parties under r16.4 and the case was listed for further hearing.\n",
      "12. On 13 December 2018 the case came before Newton J and various case management\n",
      "directions were made, including provision for applications to be made for expert\n",
      "evidence. On 25 January 2019 the court granted the guardian’s Part 25 application for\n",
      "there to be a psychological assessment of the family by Dr Martinez.\n",
      "13. On 18 February 2019 the local authority confirmed that they had now completed\n",
      "parenting assessments and would be closing their file.\n",
      "14. On 9 April 2019 final judgment was given in the matrimonial finance proceedings.\n",
      "Some of her conclusions and findings bear repetition here because they are of direct\n",
      "relevance to the matters and issues that have been raised in these proceedings relating\n",
      "to the children.\n",
      "15. Part of the matrimonial finance judgment at paragraph 95 dealt with M’s allegations\n",
      "that –\n",
      "F is intent on destroying her and has done hitherto all in his\n",
      "power to achieve that by way of his constant complaints to\n",
      "outside agencies.\n",
      "16. In respect of that part of M’s case, the judge said –\n",
      "Her case is he has lost her clients, reported two of her staff to\n",
      "the police, reported her and her family numerous times to the\n",
      "police, Children’s Services, the HMRC and more. Whether that\n",
      "is true or not in some ways doesn’t matter as I am left in now\n",
      "doubt from listening to her, not just what she said but the\n",
      "ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH\n",
      "COURT JUDGE\n",
      "Approved Judgment\n",
      "manner in which she said it, and watching her physical\n",
      "reactions, that she absolutely believes it to be true.\n",
      "17. At that hearing it was confirmed that M had been summonsed to appear at Town A\n",
      "Magistrates Court on 23 April 2019 to answer a charge contrary to s1(1) and (3) of the\n",
      "Computer Misuse Act 1990. MGM and her husband, Mr MGM, were also charged\n",
      "with the same offences.\n",
      "18. At paragraphs 112 and 113 of the matrimonial finance judgment, the judge concluded\n",
      "that F –\n",
      "…is a man determined to remain in litigation with the Wife at\n",
      "all costs and he tries to make her life as difficult as possible. I\n",
      "have formed the impression his actions are all consuming for\n",
      "him but also that he has lost sight of the bigger picture.\n",
      "Whatever the rights and wrongs of the computer charge, and I\n",
      "have no idea of what evidence there is to support it, and whilst\n",
      "not condoning criminal activity should it be proved, the net\n",
      "effect of being charged I am told will be her professional\n",
      "suspension and if convicted, it is in all likelihood going to\n",
      "result in a permanent bar on work in the insurance field…I am\n",

      "22. In May 2019 M, MGM and Mr MGM were notified by the CPS that the criminal case\n",
      "against them was to be discontinued. The reason provided by the CPS was that there\n",
      "was not enough evidence to support a realistic prospect of conviction.\n",
      "23. At an interim hearing on 14 June 2019 an order was made by consent that the children\n",
      "should live with F. Various recitals were made as to interim contact. The parties\n",
      "agreed that enquiries were to be made of family therapists to undertake the family\n",

      "25. At the next hearing on 23 Sept 2019 it was planned to review the progress of B’s\n",
      "work with the family. F said the therapeutic work was progressing satisfactorily, but\n",
      "that further work was needed to enable further progress to be made. However, M said\n",
      "no real progress was being made with the therapeutic work, that contact was not\n",
      "progressing or being promoted, and she raised concerns about the way in which B was\n",
      "carrying out her work with the family. The court concluded that B lacked the\n",
      "necessary expertise to undertake the work recommended by Dr Martinez and agreed\n",
      "that a further professional would need to assess and work with the family. MGM was\n",
      "joined as a party.\n",
      "26. On 26 September 2019 the court ordered that the Family Separation Clinic, on M’s\n",
      "application, should be instructed to undertake an assessment and to carry out\n",
      "therapeutic work with the family. The Family Separation Clinic was directed to\n",
      "provide a report about progress by 5 December 2019. However, by 12 November\n",
      "2019 it had become clear that the Family Separation Clinic was conflicted because it\n",
      "had previously undertaken some work on the case with MGM earlier in 2019. They\n",
      "therefore formally withdrew from the case.\n",
      "27. On 19 November 2019 the court ordered the instruction of Dr Berelowitz in place of\n",

      "also agreed that the guardian would convene a family meeting with members of both\n",

      "Royal Free Hospital. He had been instructed to undertake an holistic assessment as to\n",
      "why the children are refusing contact with M and MGM. He was invited to carry out\n",
      "assessment and therapy as he saw fit. Dr Berelowitz summarised the historical\n",
      "positions taken by both parents, as well as the opinions of various professionals who\n",
      "ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH\n",
      "COURT JUDGE\n",

      "have worked with the family. He carried out various interviews with family members\n",
      "including the parents, children and MGM.\n",
      "29. At that stage Dr Berelowitz concluded that all of the children were clear that F’s\n",
      "attitude was that he would support contact if they wanted it, but not that he was\n",
      "actively trying to promote it. Dr Berelowitz’s view at that stage was that the children\n",
      "had not been given the impression by F that he thought that contact is firmly in their\n",
      "interests, and overall they had a shared narrative with F about how they came to be\n",
      "where they are.\n",
      "30. Dr Berelowitz described this as a case involving a level of discord and suspicion that\n",
      "is striking even by the unusual standards of contested family law proceedings. He\n",
      "recommended a fact-finding hearing to consider the allegations that were made to him\n",
      "by both parents during his meetings with them. A fact-finding hearing was therefore\n",
      "listed for 24 August 2020.\n",
      "31. In April 2020 the guardian began regular video calls with the parents with a view to\n",
      "progressing the issue of contact. At that stage M’s last contact with the children had\n",
      "been in August 2018, almost two years previously. The guardian had consistently\n",
      "made it clear to the parents that the video calls were entirely voluntary, were not\n",
      "directed by the court and could be stopped at any time should either parent wish. The\n",
      "guardian noted that at times the calls were extremely difficult and progress had often\n",
      "been slow due to the very evident levels of hostility and suspicion that both parents\n",
      "continued to exhibit towards one another. Both parents told the guardian at various\n",
      "times that they felt bullied and intimidated by the other parent, and each regarded\n",
      "themselves as a victim of domestic abuse by the other. However, the guardian\n",
      "reported to the hearing on 4 August 2020 that notwithstanding these concerns, both\n",
      "parents had continued to engage with him over the past few months with a view to\n",
      "progressing the issue of contact.\n",
      "32. Since April 2020 some small progress with contact was therefore made, although at\n",
      "times it appeared to the guardian as somewhat slow and frustrating. However, efforts\n",
      "to reintroduce M’s contact appeared to have started very well and good progress was\n",
      "made initially with an exchange of letters and the more recent video messages.\n",
      "33. On 26 June 2020 the guardian discussed with both parents starting direct contact at\n",
      "the Town B Centre. This is a contact services facilitator commissioned by CAFCASS\n",
      "in private law and r16.4 cases to facilitate contact where it is deemed necessary to\n",
      "reintroduce contact with the non-resident parent. In this case the guardian had\n",
      "commissioned six sessions in which the Town B Centre would try to work with the\n",
      "children and the parents to overcome any fears they may have about seeing M. The\n",
      "aim of this work was to reduce anxiety for the children.\n",
      "The fact-finding hearing\n",
      "34. I conducted a five day fact-finding hearing in person in August 2020 and heard\n",
      "evidence from both parents and various members of both extended families. At that\n",
      "hearing F represented himself, very ably, in person. I did not hear evidence from the\n",

      " F deliberately lied about M and MGM having ‘knobbled’ a judge when talking to Q (a\n",
      "family friend) in order to harm M’s case.\n",
      " F has deliberately lied about the children having exhibited sexualised behaviour,\n",

      " F has damaged the children’s relationship with M.\n",
      " F failed to support the children in relationships with the wider maternal family\n",
      "thereby alienating them from their maternal family.\n",
      " F has excluded M from exercising parental responsibility for the children since they\n",
      "have been in his care.\n",
      " F deliberately sought to curtail M’s exercise of parental responsibility in respect of\n",
      "X’s proposed school move.\n",

      "331. Ultimately it is for parents to make decisions about\n",

      "foremost reason for contact not happening is the clearly voiced\n",
      "and consistent wishes of the children, and he says that had the\n",
      "children been willing to go to contact then there would be no\n",

      "decision about contact with their mother was not and is not a\n",

      "334. Only time will tell if he is truly able to demonstrate a\n",
      "change in that attitude and behaviour.\n",
      "38. I also considered various allegations made by F against M, which although not\n",
      "reduced to schedule form, were clearly being advanced by him (and had been for\n",
      "some time). Those allegations were that one of the children had made an unspecified\n",

      "M’s position\n",
      "45. M is now in a loving, stable relationship with her second husband, Mr M, and is step-\n",
      "mother to his daughter, VM. She accepts completely that her actions in August 2018\n",
      "and the Cornwall incident have had a catastrophic effect on the children, feels\n",
      "ashamed and wants the children to know they can trust her again. M’s primary\n",
      "position (as set out in her application dated 1 April 2020) has consistently been to\n",
      "seek a transfer of residence of all three children to her care. The reasons for her\n",

      "the children have suffered and are suffering emotional harm as a result of F’s ongoing\n",
      "inability to allow them to have a full relationship with her and the maternal family. M\n",
      "also seeks an order that, in the event that a transfer of residence is ordered, then X’s\n",
      "school should be changed.\n",
      "46. However, in the event that a shared care arrangement was determined to be in the\n",
      "children’s best interests, then M proposed an alternating weekend arrangement which\n",
      "is similar to the shared care arrangement that is successfully in operation for VM.\n",
      "This arrangement effectively splits each week into 2:3:2.\n",
      "47. M also proposed that the holidays and other key dates should be shared equally.\n",
      "F’s position\n",
      "48. In his statement dated 8 February 2021, F’s primary position was to oppose change of\n",
      "residence on the basis that it was the most draconian option available to the court. To\n",
      "use his words, he says he has –\n",
      "…made significant changes, worked really hard and moved\n",

      "49. At the start of the hearing, F proposed that the children would benefit the most from\n",
      "having meaningful relationships with both parents under a shared care order, and said\n",
      "it is important for the children to know that their parents are both parenting them\n",
      "together. He thought a shared care arrangement would help the children to settle into\n",
      "the contact pattern with both parents more quickly. He also thought that this was\n",
      "already happening with Y and Z and that they are doing well with this pattern. He said\n",
      "he thought that if X could see Y and Z settled into this routine and coming and going\n",
      "happily between the parents, then that would assist her in moving to that pattern. He\n",

      "would cause the children least disruption and they stand to gain the most from it in the\n",
      "long term. He said he feels guilty that his own behaviour has harmed them.\n",

      "court could order, although he did not agree with this plan. However, his case was that\n",
      "if such an order was made, then he would do his best to facilitate the order and not\n",
      "make things harder for the children.\n",
      "51. However, at the start of Day 2 of the hearing, as Dr Berelowitz was part through his\n",
      "evidence, in an entirely unexpected turn of events, Ms Musgrave indicated that F’s\n",
      "position had now changed. That position was subsequently set out in a position\n",

      "about her but would not be pressed as to why.\n",

      "what the boundaries are. Any person in whom X confides and\n",
      "who is not aware of the detail of the case is vulnerable to\n",
      "reinforcing the alienation.\n",
      "143. In his oral evidence he developed the point, explaining that if a plan of X staying with\n",
      "F was still being contemplated, the goal of any therapy for X should be to help undo\n",

      "quite clear that it would be unethical and inappropriate to place X into therapy that\n",
      "seeks to pull her in a direction in which she does not want to go. He said – ‘that’s why\n",

      "THE CHILDREN’S WISHES AND FEELINGS\n",
      "144. Dr Berelowitz describes each of the children as expressing different wishes and\n",
      "feelings. It is his expert opinion that the extent to which they have been alienated\n",
      "greatly affects their ascertainable wishes and feelings. Thus, the more the child is\n",
      "alienated, the less their ascertainable wishes and feelings should be taken at face\n",
      "value, and the more need there is for a comprehensive and holistic approach to\n",

      "should pay less regard to X’s wishes and feelings about contact with M than I should\n",
      "to those of the other children. Dr Berelowitz also observes that when a child is\n",
      "alienated from one parent, they often become much more dependent on the parent\n",
      "with whom they reside.\n",
      "145. The guardian has extensively consulted the children and sought their views about their\n",
      "living and contact arrangements. He has also had extensive contact with the parents\n",
      "during the period of his involvement. He observes that although at times F asserts that\n",
      "he is just passing on what the children are telling him, in his experience of working\n",
      "with the family in the past two years, it is very difficult to separate F’s views from\n",

      "Approved Judgment\n",
      "those of the children and at times it seems that F’s narrative is so often the same as\n",
      "that of the children. The guardian considers that given the findings of alienation, it is\n",
      "therefore likely that the children's view of M is still being heavily influenced by F.\n",
      "The guardian says that the children’s wishes and feelings are not formed in a vacuum,\n",
      "and a question therefore arises as to how much weight should be given to their views.\n",
      "He says –\n",
      "I respect and acknowledge the views expressed by the children,\n",
      "but these views must be seen in the context of their previous\n",
      "experiences and the fact that they have been significantly\n",
      "alienated against their mother.\n",
      "146. The guardian is concerned that if decision-making is led by the children's wishes\n",
      "alone, which is largely what F said he was doing and following between August 2018\n",
      "and September 2020, they will continue to suffer psychological harm due to alienation\n",
      "from M, which consequently risks further mental health problems as they grow older.\n",
      "147. That analysis is endorsed by Dr Berelowitz, and I accept their combined evidence on\n",
      "this point about how much weight should be attached to the wishes and feelings of\n",
      "alienated children in general, and to these children in particular. Thus the approach I\n",
      "have taken in this case is that the more the child is alienated, the less I should take\n",
      "their ascertainable wishes and feelings at face value, and the more I need to apply a\n",
      "comprehensive and holistic approach to helping them with their alienation.\n",
      "X\n",
      "148. The guardian describes X as having been consistent and very vocal about wanting to\n",
      "live with F. Of the three children, she has always been the strongest in resisting\n",
      "spending time with M and saying that she does not want to live with her. She has\n",
      "persistently and consistently said that she did not want to see M and the maternal\n",
      "family. She feels frustrated that the guardian is not listening to her as she is clear\n",
      "about her wishes. She is very rigid in her thinking, according to the guardian, and\n",
      "would not accept anything negative being said about F, whereas by contrast she is\n",
      "very negative about M, describing her as a bully, and says she does not deserve the\n",
      "title ‘mum’. The guardian’s conclusion is that X appears to be aligned to F as a way of\n",
      "protecting herself from the trauma of what happened in the past, and her fears are then\n",
      "compounded by the alienation she has experienced. X does not accept that F\n",
      "contributed to the harm that the children suffered by alienating them against M and\n",

      "alienated, and that it will be hardest of all for her to move on from the feelings of\n",
      "alienation. He describes her having ended up with entrenched negative views about\n",
      "her mother and an idealised view of her father. He says she is very persuasive about\n",
      "this, to herself and also to other people, hence his concern about the work with U. He\n",

      "150. I have read a letter written to me by X at school recently as exhibited to the guardian’s\n",

      "Firstly she does not feel safe around her. Secondly M lies a lot about X’s memories\n",

      "with different thoughts. She said she does not want to see M but her brother and sister\n",

      "maybe she will want to see her in the future.\n",
      "151. Dr Berelowitz has considered the Cafcass guidance on parental alienation and advises\n",
      "that it is vital to look at the whole picture and also the severity of the alienation. He\n",
      "describes X as being the child who was most strongly affected at the time by M’s\n",
      "health issues and who is the child who is most alienated. He describes her as\n",
      "challenging and aggressive to M and seems to believe that she needs one parent only.\n",

      "Furthermore, Dr Berelowitz notes the unfortunate consequence for X of taking such\n",
      "an entrenched position; in other words she pays a price for taking that position which\n",
      "means she has less time with her siblings, but she still cannot readily change.\n",
      "Y\n",
      "152. When the guardian first started working with Y she did not want to see M and\n",
      "expressed strong views against spending time with the maternal family. However she\n",
      "was the first to take significant steps to resuming contact with M, including writing\n",
      "letters, recording videos, and talking on video. The guardian describes Y as appearing\n",
      "to be ‘the shining light’ in leading the way to resuming contact with M. She has\n",
      "always been the most amenable to resuming contact, and the guardian was not\n",
      "surprised that she was the first one of the children to engage in a video call with M\n",
      "and was the first of the children to see her at the first Town B Centre session.\n",
      "153. The guardian reports that Y continues to be positive about spending time with M, and\n",

      "155. The guardian describes Z as a child who is very confused about everything that has\n",
      "happened to him and what is now happening. When the guardian talked to Z about his\n",
      "views about his living arrangements, he expressed – as he always has done – that he\n",
      "wants to live with F and doesn't want to see M. He alleged that M was bargaining by\n",
      "allowing the children their screens and phones and threatening to take them away if\n",
      "they did not do what she wants. He was very negative about M stating that if there\n",
      "was one irritating person who had ruined his life, it was her. Yet at the same time, he\n",
      "has said that while he does not want to see M, he also said that he wants to help her.\n",
      "156. Dr Berelowitz is of the opinion that Z falls between X and Y in terms of the extent to\n",
      "which he is or is not alienated from M. There is a lack of congruence between what Z\n",
      "says and what he does. Z’s expressed views are clear: he does not want to live with or\n",

      "what he tells professionals. He appears to enjoy spending time with her and has\n",
      "attended every session as ordered by the court, albeit with some difficult handovers.\n",
      "157. The guardian’s view is that this indicates that Z is struggling with loyalty, conflict and\n",
      "wanting to please F, a situation compounded by the fact that the children were\n",
      "alienated against M which involved psychological manipulation. Dr Berelowitz\n",
      "describes Z’s language as putting him closer to X, but his behaviour puts him closer to\n",

      "parental alienation and the significant harm to which he was exposed.\n",
      "THE CHILDREN’S NEEDS\n",
      "158. Both the guardian and Dr Berelowitz agree that, optimally, what all three children\n",
      "need is to have a rich and full relationship with both parents. All three children also\n",
      "need to feel safe when in the care of their parents. For the period they have been in the\n",
      "care of F there have not been any substantiated concerns about their physical safety.\n",
      "As I have already identified, Y and Z have a skin condition and it is critical that they\n",
      "are given appropriate support to look after their skin.\n",
      "159. In considering the children’s needs, the guardian relies on the professional definition\n",
      "of resilience as being the ability to persevere and thrive in the face of exposure to\n",
      "adverse situations. They are a sibling group who very much love each other, but they\n",
      "are also individuals with different personalities. And although by and large they were\n",
      "exposed to the same to the same or similar traumatic events in 2016 and 2018, their\n",
      "levels of resilience are different. Dr Berelowitz explained that in this situation where\n",
      "there are three children who have been alienated from their mother, they will tend not\n",
      "to follow the same paths. He said that each makes their own adjustments, and for each\n",
      "of them a different narrative exists. That can continue even if their relationship with\n",
      "the alienated parent, in this case M, improves. He advised strongly that it is therefore\n",
      "important to look at the children as individuals, and said it would be a mistake to treat\n",
      "them as a ‘job lot’. He cautioned against assuming that they are all the same.\n",
      "160. Despite the trauma that the children have suffered as a result of M being intoxicated\n",

      "relationship with M, including prior to this hearing an extended stay in contact for\n",
      "five nights. The guardian’s view is that this contact appears to have gone largely well.\n",
      "161. However, Dr Berelowitz cautioned that the success in contact for Y and Z is only\n",
      "relatively recent. He said the discord in the parents causes contact to hang by a thread.\n",
      "He advised that if the discord persists and there remains an ‘open psychological\n",
      "wound’ for the children, then the situation will continue to remain very fragile. While\n",
      "Y is relatively settled, the situation with Z fluctuates and is fragile, and with X, it is\n",
      "exceptionally fragile and also worrying. Dr Berelowitz’s opinion is that this is to be\n",
      "expected given the finding of alienation.\n",
      "162. Dr Berelowitz also advised during any period of protective separation from F the\n",
      "children will need not to have too many contacts in order to help them settle.\n",
      "163. Both Dr Berelowitz and the guardian have analysed X’s needs very carefully. She is\n",
      "extremely entrenched in refusing contact with M. This could be as a result of the\n",
      "previous harm caused to her and the younger children by M which should not be\n",
      "minimised. However, it is also clear that the parental alienation caused by F is an\n",
      "ongoing significant risk factor that is impacting on her relationship with M.\n",
      "164. Dr Berelowitz describes X as being somewhat stuck. The description of M that she\n",
      "gave to U, as well as her demonstrated ongoing uncertainty about contact with M,\n",
      "gives real cause for concern. He considers that X will struggle to rebuild her\n",
      "relationship with M while her entrenched negative views about M and her idealisation\n",
      "of F persist. He frankly explained that there is little agreement in his field about\n",
      "whether or not psychological interventions with a child can reverse or undo X’s\n",
      "current state of mind.\n",
      "165. If there is no transfer of residence, then it is crucial that X receives the right help, but\n",
      "it is also very important to avoid a process that reinforces the status quo which would\n",
      "be contrary to her interests. It might be that the passage of time with increasingly\n",
      "successful contact with M, including staying contact, could provide sufficient positive\n",
      "experiences such that X’s uncertainty would diminish over time. F might be able, with\n",
      "the help of a suitable therapist, to give X a more comprehensive message about how\n",
      "his own behaviour impacted upon the evolution of her feelings about M. The same\n",
      "could apply to M. So there may be scope for X and the parents to have a modified\n",
      "form of systemic therapy, in which X and F, and X and M, have joint sessions with\n",
      "the same therapist.\n",
      "166. In terms of possible therapeutic work for X in the future, Dr Berelowitz said that the\n",
      "challenge is to identify the purpose of the therapy. He said that what X needs is a clear\n",
      "expression by F that it is the conduct of the adults that has made things harder for her,\n",
      "and his unwavering commitment must be to help get her to understand that point. He\n",
      "also advised that for any shared care arrangement to work, F needs to convey to X\n",
      "that he knows she is apprehensive because of him for which he is sorry and that he\n",
      "wants to do whatever he can to help her. He said it is clear that F has the capacity to\n",
      "influence the children a very great deal and that F needs to acknowledge his power\n",
      "and influence.\n",
      "167. Dr Berelowitz confirmed in evidence that in this type of very complex and\n",

      "it is likely they will miss each other in the short-term. It is also reasonable to assume\n",
      "that such separation is likely to have a lasting effect on their relationships in the\n",
      "future. However, Dr Berelowitz advised that it is impossible to predict what the effect\n",
      "on X would be of X and Y beginning to improve their relationships with M in those\n",
      "circumstances, and of cleaving more to M. He advised that there is likely to be no\n",
      "obviously positive outcome for X in the short-term. He explained she might dig her\n",
      "heels in and become even more obdurate in her resistance to contact with M.\n",
      "Alternatively, she might have her eyes opened. Dr Berewolitz explained it would be\n",
      "very unwise for him to predict a specific outcome, because not all children have the\n",
      "same opinions about the qualities of their parents. His concern for these children is\n",
      "that if the situation remains polarised, then X’s own life story will become mutually\n",
      "incompatible with her siblings. This could lead to a ‘wedge’ between the children, and\n",
      "he was quite frank that he cannot explain how he, as a psychiatrist, would deal with\n",
      "that situation.\n",
      "169. After F had confirmed that he now agreed to all three children transferring to live with\n",
      "M, Dr Berelowitz gave further evidence about the likely impact on the children of\n",
      "such a situation. He advised that, in the short term it is reasonable to assume that, in\n",
      "light of their expressed wishes and feelings, they will experience trauma and distress.\n",
      "They will also inevitably miss F to whom they are very closely attached. For X, it is\n",
      "likely that this will be very acute indeed, and things are likely to be very hard for her\n",
      "and M. M is likely to find X very variable.\n",
      "170. He also advised that, because the history of constructive working between the parents\n",
      "as well as that the improvement in contact for Y and Z is so recent, it is very difficult\n",
      "to predict the success of shared care in this case at this stage. He explained that most\n",
      "transfers of residence take place in the absence of successful contact. He explained\n",
      "that the duration of the period of protective separation from F depends on the success\n",
      "of the transfer.\n",
      "THE RISK OF HARM\n",
      "171. In May 2019 Dr Martinez described the relationship between F and X as follows –\n",
      "F sometimes struggled to keep his descriptions of affection and\n",
      "pleasure of his children moderate; for example, he said of X, \"\n",
      "it's like watching a tiny saint or something, she's lovely.\" And \"\n",
      "she's incredible. I'm so lucky to be associated with her. She's\n",
      "amazing. Just amazing.\". This hyperbole sometimes had the\n",
      "effect of making the interview seem quite intense. However, F’s\n",
      "descriptions and understandings of his children tempered this\n",
      "intensity. There were some moments in which F displayed some\n",
      "indications of enmeshment with his children, in particular with\n",
      "X, such as saying, \" we'll say the same thing. We'll finish each\n",
      "other's sentences. We'll have the same emotion.\" This indicates\n",
      "an aligning of the child with his own character, rather than\n",
      "allowing her agency of her own. He was, however, able to give\n",
      "ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH\n",
      "COURT JUDGE\n",
      "Approved Judgment\n",
      "examples of behaviour he does not like in the children,\n",
      "including X, such as \"I don't like it when she is sharp with her\n",
      "sister,\" which indicates that he is able to be balanced in his\n",
      "descriptions of her.\n",
      "172. In evidence, Dr Berelowitz characterised this alignment and enmeshment as\n",
      "concerning; he said it demonstrates an inability by both X and F to separate from each\n",
      "other which leads him to feel concerned about how difficult it would be for them to\n",
      "develop separate views from each other. While this may not have been deliberate or\n",
      "intentional behaviour on F’s part, Dr Berelowitz is also clear that things have not\n",
      "improved and are significantly worse now.\n",
      "173. F asserts that he is doing his best to promote contact and has been inspired by Dr\n",
      "Berelowitz’s first report to be more firm in pushing the children to see their mother.\n",
      "However, I accept the guardian's analysis that, while F may be genuinely trying to do\n",
      "his best to promote contact, it should not be ignored that he either intentionally or\n",
      "unintentionally instilled in the children such a fear of their mother due to past events,\n",
      "that they initially were absolutely adamant they did not want to have contact with her\n",
      "or her wider family. The guardian’s view is that F has exploited this to his advantage.\n",
      "I also accept that analysis, although it is impossible to reach any conclusion about F’s\n",
      "motivation or intention in this regard.\n",
      "174. The guardian has plainly considered very carefully the risks to the children of having\n",
      "suffered alienation as I have found. He said this –\n",
      "Alienation of a child can be compared to a non-accidental\n",
      "injury of the mind and it raises significant concern about risk of\n",
      "harm. Alienation causes psychological harm to a child, which\n",
      "although may not be too obvious compared to physical abuse,\n",
      "should still be treated as an abusive behaviour. It violates a\n",
      "child’s sense of self, their right to choose, their identity and\n",
      "relationships with significant others. While I do not seek to\n",
      "minimise the harm caused to the children by their mother, I\n",
      "also do not seek to minimise the harm caused by their father\n",
      "either.\n",

      "September 2020. Due to concerns regarding X’s alleged vomiting and nightmares that\n",
      "F was reporting, the guardian was by then very concerned about X’s mental health,\n",
      "although no expert recommendation was made for her to undertake therapeutic work\n",
      "at that time. It was therefore in that context that the guardian suggested a befriending\n",
      "service for X with U where she could talk to someone who was not a family member\n",
      "about issues that were affecting her and also lessen her anxieties about seeing M and\n",
      "the maternal family. Both parents agreed with his suggestion and agreed to pay for the\n",
      "service, although F was initially opposed as he did not think that X had any mental\n",
      "health issues. The guardian made it clear to the parents that he was not making any\n",
      "diagnosis of mental health problems because he was not qualified to do so, but did\n",
      "feel that X needed support in one way or another. Although U helped X to have\n",

      "176. As discussed above, Dr Berelowitz highlighted that U’s note relating to 29 October\n",
      "2020 is a powerful and disconcerting example of the impact of parental alienation, not\n",
      "only on the child but also on the well intentioned professional network.\n",
      "177. Dr Berelowitz wondered why in such a complicated case X was indeed even being\n",
      "supported by a volunteer, to what ends, and what the boundaries are. He said that any\n",
      "person in whom X confides and who is not aware of the detail of the case is\n",
      "vulnerable to reinforcing the alienation.\n",
      "178. Dr Berelowitz has considered ways in which the harm to the children that has already\n",
      "occurred could be ameliorated in the future. He said that unfortunately the level of\n",
      "mistrust in this case is so great that he does not think that the family can see any\n",
      "professional person with whom one of them has already had privileged conversations.\n",
      "It is for that reason he does not think Dr D is an option for providing systemic family\n",
      "therapy. Dr Berelowitz also commented that the state of play between the parents is\n",
      "such that it seems unlikely that mediation or therapy for the parents together, with or\n",
      "without the children, is currently possible. That echoes the view that I expressed at an\n",
      "earlier stage in these proceedings. Dr Berelowitz says he would very much like to be\n",
      "wrong about this and that it would be wonderful if a suggestion of systemic therapy\n",
      "could be taken up. He says that the great thing about systemic therapy is that it is a\n",
      "blame-free approach which looks at ways of nudging people out of entrenched\n",
      "patterns. He says however that he just does not think these parents are there yet. I\n",
      "agree.\n",
      "179. X appears to have been severely affected by alienation, in that she is rejecting of M\n",
      "and the maternal family. The guardian agrees with Dr Berelowitz that there is a risk of\n",
      "being diverted from the most significant factor that is causing X to reject M, namely\n",
      "the alienation caused by F, towards too great a focus on presenting ‘symptoms’ such\n",
      "as vomiting and the emotional distress that she is displaying. It is well documented\n",
      "that the children suffered previous harm in M’s care, including neglect of their basic\n",
      "needs and being physically hurt when she was intoxicated with alcohol and suffering\n",
      "from poor mental health in 2016 and 2018. That was confirmed in the local authority\n",

      "static risk factor and observes that she accepted she is an alcoholic during the fact-\n",
      "finding hearing. She knows she must abstain from alcohol and there is no evidence to\n",
      "suggest that she has relapsed since these proceedings have been underway.\n",

      "of what happened with their mother in the past (albeit that M says many of these\n",
      "memories are distorted), but it is the harm caused by the established alienation that\n",
      "must not be ignored. He identifies two problems that the children need to be\n",

      "health and attachment problems. The guardian questions whether F has been doing\n",
      "enough to correct some distortions held by X. The guardian is concerned about the\n",

      "bargaining by wanting sympathy for events of the past. She appears to justify her\n",
      "rejection of M by saying that forcing her to spend time with them will cause her\n",

      "raised during these proceedings that have taken up considerable amounts of time and\n",

      "previously tried to obtain, but was prevented from doing so by the GP surgery due to\n",
      "them being under the impression that she was not entitled to see them. Last year a\n",

      "records have not been shared with anyone else and I have not seen them. The guardian\n",
      "confirms that he does not believe the notes contain a great deal of information that is\n",
      "not already known about, although he cannot say for certain. What is important,\n",
      "however, is that it is clear from the notes that the surgery was indeed told previously\n",
      "not to disclose information to M. In the guardian’s view it is also clear from the notes\n",
      "that M was again excluded from exercising her parental responsibility as F is the only\n",
      "parent listed on the form. This is a reflection of the previous findings made by the\n",
      "court in relation to F excluding M from decisions about the children’s schooling and\n",
      "represents yet a further example of him seeking to restrict M’s exercise of her parental\n",
      "responsibility.\n",
      "198. The fact that this issue even required a court order and had come to the attention of\n",
      "the court and the guardian is another example of the way in which F's actions,\n",
      "whether inadvertent or deliberate, have undermined M’s role as the children's mother\n",
      "and as a parent with parental responsibility, as well as also causing upheaval and\n",
      "unnecessary work for professionals involved in the case.\n",
      "199. In terms of F’s progress, ultimately Dr Berelowitz poses three questions that needs to\n",
      "be answered about his apparent progress following the fact finding hearing. Firstly, he\n",
      "asks if F is indeed progressing in the right direction, and if he is progressing fast\n",
      "enough. Dr Berelowitz essentially answers in the negative, by saying although there\n",
      "has been considerable progress latterly, X’s and Z’s relationships with M are far from\n",
      "being well enough established. Secondly he asks if F is indisputably moving in one\n",
      "direction only. Again, he answers in the negative, saying that in his view F is not and\n",
      "that he is still sometimes pulled in the opposite direction with consequences. Thirdly,\n",
      "he asks if F’s progress will be sustained. He says unequivocally that in his own view\n",
      "this is too early to tell and the discord between the parents does not help.\n",
      "200. In terms of whether any of his conclusions and recommendations as initially outlined\n",
      "in his first report had changed, he said his concerns about the hostility between the\n",
      "parents still apply. His previous concerns still apply most of all to X but also to Z –\n",
      "The absence of a rich and full relationship with their mother\n",
      "increases the long-term risk of psychological problems, as does\n",
      "the exposure to discord.\n",

      "COURT JUDGE\n",
      "Approved Judgment\n",
      "The more complicated worry is in relation to M’s arguments,\n",
      "namely that F has amplified any anxiety that the children might\n",

      "the children will end up with an entrenched negative view of M\n",

      "ANALYSIS OF THE REALISTIC OPTIONS FOR THE CHILDREN\n",
      "201. Dr Berelowitz is of the opinion that the degree of alienation is such and the stakes are\n",
      "so high for the parents and the children that the range of effective solutions is now\n",
      "limited. He is also refreshingly frank when he says it is important to be clear that\n",
      "within his wider professional field there is little research and little agreement about\n",
      "what would constitute the best way forward at such a time. To the best of his\n",
      "knowledge there is no good quality information available about the outcomes of\n",
      "particular interventions and/or about the outcome of not intervening.\n",
      "202. Dr Berelowitz is clear that X cannot undertake psychotherapy aimed at taking her in a\n",
      "direction to which she has not agreed to go. However he says it is reasonable to\n",
      "expect her to attend joint sessions with a parent to work on the issues relating to that\n",
      "parent and on the need not to undermine her siblings, but that intervention is likely to\n",
      "take time to be effective and may in any event work only partially. While the work is\n",
      "incomplete the impact on the siblings is likely to persist.\n",
      "203. Dr Berelowitz advises that such work with X and F should not be attempted unless the\n",
      "court can be confident to a very high degree that F can be relied upon unequivocally\n",
      "and wholeheartedly to support the work and that furthermore his other actions do not\n",
      "pull X in the opposite direction. At this point having listened to F in evidence in\n",
      "August 2020 very carefully and having considered all the evidence available at this\n",
      "time, I do not consider that it is possible to find that F could be relied upon\n",
      "unequivocally and wholeheartedly to support such work. He may not intend that his\n",
      "actions would pull X in the opposite direction, however I think the likelihood of him\n",
      "doing so, even in the most well-meaning way at best or deliberately at worst, presents\n",
      "a greater risk.\n",
      "204. Dr Berelowitz is also clear that it is not possible to separate X from her siblings while\n",
      "they reside in the same home. However he says it is possible to keep her much more\n",
      "separate than has been in the past when it comes to specific contact arrangements.\n",
      "205. The guardian accepts that X is suffering alienation in F’s care, but at the same time\n",
      "needs to balance this against the risk of causing further harm if she is forced to live\n",
      "with M. This is undoubtedly a difficult balancing exercise. The guardian also takes\n",
      "into consideration that X is about to turn 12 and is therefore older than her siblings.\n",
      "She appears to be doing well in school and has made friends with her peers. It is with\n",

      "approach is needed when dealing with X’s situation.\n",

      "that it is very difficult to predict the success of shared care in this case at this stage.\n",
      "207. At the start of this hearing there appeared to be four realistic options available to the\n",

      "Option 1\n",
      "All the children continuing to live with F.\n",
      "Option 2\n",
      "A shared care arrangement for all three children (both parents ultimately\n",

      "Option 3\n",
      "All the children transferring to live with M\n",
      "Option 4\n",
      "Splitting the children so that Y and Z transfer to live with M, and X remains\n",
      "living with F.\n",
      "208. However, on Day 1 of the hearing, Ms Musgrave who now represents F confirmed\n",
      "that, having given matters great thought, F was now likely to be advocating Option 2\n",
      "as his primary position, but that he wanted to hear Dr Berelowitz’s evidence before\n",
      "completely confirming his position.\n",
      "209. Dr Berelowitz commenced but did not complete his evidence on the afternoon of Day\n",
      "1. Just before he resumed on the morning of Day 2, Ms Musgrave confirmed that F\n",
      "now agreed the children should not be separated; as such, he accepted that all three\n",
      "children should be placed into M’s care for a period of protected separation. This\n",
      "represented a very significant and unprecedented change in F’s case. It was\n",
      "acknowledged by all involved, including Dr Berelowitz and the guardian, that his\n",
      "decision has involved considerable fortitude and courage. Through counsel, F has\n",
      "given his commitment to making the transfer of residence work. It was said on his\n",
      "behalf that F had concluded that the transfer might break the impasse, and he was also\n",
      "very concerned that splitting the children could lead to a rupture in the children’s\n",
      "relationships with each other. He accepts that the children need to have a more\n",
      "meaningful relationship with M.\n",
      "210. In a position statement submitted on his behalf, F confirmed that he did not oppose an\n",
      "order transferring residence to M at this hearing, although ultimately still seeks a\n",
      "shared care arrangement with M, where the children can move between the parents\n",
      "easily and have full relationships with both of them.\n",
      "211. Dr Berelowitz was then able to give his opinion about the change in F’s position from\n",
      "the witness box. He said that F’s agreement created an opportunity for a dialogue with\n",
      "the children about the history of alienation, and an opportunity to explain that this is\n",
      "the best way for the children to settle with M. He said it provides an opportunity for\n",
      "the children to have positive relationships with both parents, and it is much easier to\n",

      "COURT JUDGE\n",
      "Approved Judgment\n",
      "explain things to the children if it is agreed between them, rather than being ordered\n",
      "by the court. He described this as ‘exquisitely difficult territory’. In light of F’s\n",
      "changed position, he was quite clear that, while there should be a period of ‘protective\n",
      "separation’, this should not be a punitive experience for F. He said that F needs to\n",
      "explain to X that he will not be responding to her texts or phone calls, and said that\n",
      "there must be no secret or back channels of communication to the children. He also\n",
      "said that any evidence that F later reneges on his commitment to making this\n",
      "arrangement work could be seen as a form of emotional abuse. He said that secrets\n",
      "between pairs of family members should be avoided, and that secrets should not be\n",
      "used to create intimacy between family members.\n",
      "212. Dr Berelowitz confirmed that this could be the sea change in F for which all parties\n",
      "and professionals have been waiting, provided that the period of transfer and\n",
      "protective separation is used well.\n",
      "213. I adjourned the case overnight to enable the parties to draw up a proposed transfer\n",
      "plan which was then sent to Dr Berelowitz to consider. The following morning, Dr\n",
      "Berelowitz and the guardian discussed and slightly revised the plan, and Dr\n",
      "Berelowitz then resumed his evidence for a third day to explain the thinking behind\n",
      "the revised proposal. Both he and the guardian agreed that the children should not be\n",
      "told about the plan until they were in M’s care. He agreed that the children could feel\n",
      "‘tricked’ and that it could make things worse, at least in the short term for M;\n",
      "however, he was clear that this was the best option in an imperfect situation. He did\n",
      "say that in fact the words used with the children were less critically important than the\n",
      "actions afterwards. He advised that M should tell the children together, followed by a\n",
      "remote meeting with F and the guardian. He advised there should be no contact for at\n",
      "least three weeks with F, but that M should contact F by email once or twice a week\n",
      "in that period to update him on how the children were doing. He was clear that he\n",
      "could not set out a roadmap for resuming contact at this stage but said that because the\n",
      "guardian has such a good feel for the issues in this case, the parents should be guided\n",
      "by his judgment. However, he was clear that there should be no direct contact until\n",
      "the matter has been reviewed by the court after three months. He advised that X and\n",
      "M will need immediate therapeutic support during the transition period and has\n",
      "considered names suggested to him and advised M on recommended family therapists\n",
      "who can carry out that work.\n",
      "214. The guardian’s view had been that in the absence of total commitment from F, then a\n",
      "transfer of all three children would be unlikely to be successful. He has plainly given\n",
      "a great deal of thought to the best outcome for the children. In his final report he\n",
      "stated that –\n",
      "Whilst I would ideally like for X to move to the care of her\n",
      "mother with her two younger siblings and whilst I believe that\n",
      "doing so would ultimately give her the best chance of having a\n",
      "meaningful relationship with both parents, I have to take into\n",
      "account the very real risk of X undermining that placement for\n",
      "Y and Z, particularly in the early days, and the fact that trying\n",
      "to force her to live with her mother will cause a huge amount of\n",

      "COURT JUDGE\n",
      "Approved Judgment\n",
      "215. On Day 3 of this hearing he confirmed his cautiously revised opinion as follows –\n",
      "It has always been the guardian’s preference that all 3 children\n",
      "remain living together. The guardian has had to consider this\n",
      "in the context of X’s entrenched negative views of her mother\n",
      "and the impact this may have on the other children. further the\n",
      "guardian has to consider the very limited contact X has had\n",
      "with her mother, in contrast to her younger siblings. A\n",
      "significant consideration had been F’s opposition to X living\n",

      "Whilst these concerns have not evaporated the guardian\n",
      "believes that the potential opportunity for X to join her siblings\n",
      "in M’s care should be explored. The significance of F’s support\n",
      "of this plan is a critical development which leads the guardian\n",
      "to favour the revised approach, albeit cautiously so.\n",
      "216. Therefore, in light of the change in F’s position, the endorsement of a transfer sooner\n",
      "rather than later by Dr Berelowitz, and confirmation of support by the guardian, I\n",
      "agreed that it was in the children’s best interests for all three of them to transfer to live\n",
      "with M without delay. I therefore ordered the transfer of all three children to take\n",
      "place in the afternoon of Day 3 of the hearing. F agreed not to discuss the issues with\n",
      "the children or the paternal grandparents, from whom he collected the children. F then\n",

      "217. On the morning of Day 4 of the hearing, the children were told of the transfer by both\n",
      "parents – M in person, and F joining remotely. The guardian also joined this meeting\n",
      "remotely. The guardian has prepared a note of that meeting, some parts of which are\n",

      "Option 1 – all the children continue to live with F\n",

      "their mother has been tortuously slow and beset with difficulty, even as recently as\n",
      "this month. It is right to say that F’s progress is still very much in its infancy. The\n",

      "said to be realistic for that reason.\n",
      "Option 2 – a shared care arrangement for all three children\n",
      "222. The benefit of a shared care arrangement would be that it removes the burden of\n",
      "responsibility from the children. It places the locus of control firmly and equally in\n",
      "the hands of the parents. That in turn is likely to reinforce to the children that both\n",

      "223. M's case is that if the court makes a shared care arrangement F will very quickly find\n",
      "an excuse to stop contact and reinforcing the children that she is a risk to them. Her\n",
      "concern is that F will continue to create false memories in the children that she did\n",
      "something wrong. For example, he has told the children that the reason they have not\n",
      "seen her for two years was because she left to concentrate upon her career and did not\n",
      "love them. She describes sending the children many, many letters over that period,\n",
      "almost all of which they did not receive. She greatly fears that the children will grow\n",
      "up with no contact with her or the maternal family which will cause them emotional\n",
      "harm in the long term. In short, she says they will learn from F how to cause chaos\n",
      "and destruction and harm to other people which will make them unhappy and\n",
      "unpopular individuals. These are bold submissions on her part but indicate the very\n",
      "great strength of her feeling.\n",
      "224. She firmly believes that if the court now orders that there should be a shared care\n",

      "she will relapse and start to abuse alcohol and will put the children at risk. M's case is\n",
      "that there is no cogent evidence to support F’s concerns. The reality is she has now\n",
      "not drunk alcohol for two years and five months. She is also now in a very different\n",
      "emotional place and is happily married to a loving and caring husband.\n",
      "225. The risk of a shared care arrangement is that it will involve yet more chaos and\n",
      "upheaval for the children. The previous two shared care arrangements, ordered by the\n",
      "court, have failed in the past. The shared care arrangement to which both parents\n",
      "subscribe would involve also a fair amount of weekly upheaval and is likely to be\n",
      "unsettling for all three children. The proposed shared care arrangement would require\n",
      "the children to move between the houses every three or four days. A further detriment\n",
      "of this option is that it is contrary to the expressed wishes and feelings of all three\n",
      "children, particularly X.\n",
      "226. Again I find that the likely detriments of this option far outweigh any likely positives.\n",
      "In the context of such a long protracted history of acrimony and discord between the\n",
      "parents, it seems highly unlikely, if not impossible, that these parents could make such\n",
      "an arrangement work successfully, at least in the medium to long-term. Such regular\n",
      "transition between the households provide simply too many opportunities for things to\n",
      "go wrong in what remains an incredibly fragile, finely balanced and delicate situation.\n",
      "F needs to demonstrate needs to demonstrate significant and sustained shift in his\n",
      "actions and behaviour, not just his words and language. That cannot be done quickly,\n",
      "and needs to be tested and proven over time. I therefore do not consider this option to\n",
      "be realistic at this stage of these children’s lives.\n",
      "Option 3 – all the children transferring to live with M\n",
      "227. This option involves a change of residence for the children so that they can live with\n",
      "M and spend time with F. M proposes a three month rehabilitation period of\n",
      "protective separation from F which would allow all the children to settle, and would\n",
      "enable M and X to obtain therapeutic support from a family therapist.\n",
      "228. The benefit of this option is that it would enable the children to begin to take steps in\n",
      "repairing and restoring their relationship with M. It would offer an opportunity to heal\n",
      "the impacts of the alienation caused by F. If this option is combined with a period of\n",

      "short while, from the destructively alienating effect of F. And of course it would\n",

      "COURT JUDGE\n",

      "230. The detriments of this option are that it is expressly contrary to the children’s\n",
      "expressed wishes and feelings, particularly X’s, and necessarily imposes a period of\n",
      "protective separation from F. There is a risk that the children will feel punished,\n",
      "which could have a further detrimental effect on restoring their relationship with M\n",
      "and could increase their feelings of negativity towards her. If this option is combined\n",
      "with a period of protective separation from F, there is also the risk that their\n",
      "relationship with F could deteriorate. As Dr Berelowitz said, there is no point in\n",
      "replacing one alienating relationship with another. There is also a possibility that at\n",
      "least for X she could run away which is harmful to her, and risks destabilising Y and\n",
      "Z.\n",
      "231. This option inevitably cannot avoid causing a degree of emotional harm to the\n",

      "a child simply cannot be attainable, and that seeking a good enough solution is the\n",
      "only realistic option.\n",
      "232. That is ultimately why in this option, taking account of all the history and evidence\n",
      "that I have considered, the benefits do outweigh the negatives.\n",
      "Option 4 – splitting the children so that Y and Z transfer to live with M, and X remains\n",
      "living with F\n",
      "233. The benefit of this option would be that Y and Z, who are already now enjoying or\n",
      "appearing to enjoy quality contact with M, could continue to improve and restore the\n",
      "relationship with her. Another benefit is that there is no evidence to suggest that M\n",
      "would not promote their contact with F and X, and so the court could be confident\n",
      "with this option that Y and Z would continue to have the opportunity to enjoy a\n",
      "relationship with him. Another benefit of this option would be that Y and Z could\n",
      "resume good quality relationships with their extended maternal family which have, as\n",

      "option, which cannot be overlooked, is that it provokes less opportunity for X to\n",
      "undermine Y’s and Z’s relationships with M because she will get what she wants,\n",
      "namely to stay with F.\n",
      "234. The obvious detriment of this option is that the children would be separated from each\n",
      "other, and in all likelihood the impact of this on their sibling relationship would be\n",
      "damaged in the medium to longer term. This option also risks polarising the alliances\n",
      "within the family which is not in the children’s best interests. It is highly likely that\n",

      "would cause significant harm to all three children. All the concerns I have previously\n",
      "highlighted about F’s inability to promote contact would apply to X here. There is\n",

      "235. Having eliminated Option 1 and Option 2 as being unrealistic for these children at this\n",

      "ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH\n",
      "COURT JUDGE\n",
      "Approved Judgment\n",
      "each other. This has been a difficult and finely balanced exercise. Until F’s dramatic\n",
      "and significant shift in position on Day 2 of the hearing, Option 4 was the option\n",
      "reluctantly favoured by the guardian and by Dr Berelowitz.\n",
      "236. However as Dr Berelowitz has said, F’s agreement shifts the balance sufficiently,\n",
      "such that the detriments of this option outweigh the benefits. I agree. Option 3 is not\n",
      "without its risks as already identified, particularly in the short term. However, I must\n",
      "also consider the medium and long-term situation for these children. Dr Berelowitz\n",
      "reiterated that F’s attitude is an important factor; the more F supports the plan the\n",
      "more likely a move to a more shared care arrangement in the future will be. However\n",
      "the less supportive F is, the more artificial the plan will be. He thinks F understands\n",
      "this. He said that in summary Y and Z are likely to settle with M. He said he expects\n",
      "they will be sad from time to time but they will settle, but they need to be protected\n",
      "from the undermining that could happen. However, he said one possible outcome\n",
      "which is challenging and sad is that Y and Z settle well, but that X becomes ever\n",
      "dependent on F and evermore isolated. He has considered whether it would be\n",
      "possible to transfer residence for Y and Z, but leave X in F’s care. He thinks this\n",
      "would leave X vulnerable.\n",
      "237. However on the other hand if she also moves to live with them, she could disrupt\n",
      "everything; he says there are lots of questions about the pros and cons of moving X. If\n",
      "she moves and one says to her that if it doesn't work then she can go back to F, then\n",
      "we are setting up a ‘hostage to fortune’ situation where she may undermine the plan in\n",
      "order to go back to F. At the time of meeting the guardian, Dr Berelowitz’s mind was\n",
      "not made up. However, he thought that splitting the children as a proposal would\n",
      "certainly safeguard Y and Z. He said in his opinion a lot still depends on F’s capacity\n",
      "to change. If this works well and he manages to change, this will be a magnet that\n",
      "draws X into a relationship with him and her siblings. However if it does not work F\n",
      "and X could become more isolated, she could move away and have nothing to do with\n",
      "M and the siblings. Dr Berelowitz cannot predict whether it will be one or the other.\n",
      "In his opinion a lot will also depend on how M proposes that it would work and would\n",
      "be managed if X was to move as well.\n",
      "238. I find that, in all the circumstances, the risks of Option 4 are greater than the risks of\n",
      "Option 3 in terms of the likelihood of harm to the children in the medium and short-\n",
      "term.\n",
      "THE TRANSFER OF RESIDENCE\n",
      "239. Dr Berelowitz was asked in terms to advise how any change of residence should be\n",
      "managed, including whether there should be a period of no contact between the\n",
      "children and F, and, if so, for how long and how contact should be re-introduced at\n",
      "the end of it. He was also asked to give his view as to what each of the children\n",
      "should be told about a change of residence. Finally he was asked to give his opinion,\n",
      "based on his previous assessment of them and the updating evidence with which he\n",
      "had been provided, how each child is likely to respond emotionally to a change of\n",
      "residence. Dr Berelowitz advised that this is an area for which there is little published\n",
      "evidence and about which there is little professional discourse and so his opinions are\n",
      "offered very much with caution in mind. He observes that the usual practice is to\n",
      "transfer children without notice and from a neutral venue if at all possible. He said\n",
      "ELIZABETH ISAACS QC SITTING AS A DEPUTY HIGH\n",
      "COURT JUDGE\n",
      "Approved Judgment\n",
      "that where contact is already taking place, the contact should simply be extended and\n",
      "converted into residence. He said that telling children in advance that they are going\n",
      "to move increases the likelihood of a traumatic incident.\n",
      "240. Dr Berelowitz advised that during and in the period immediately after the transfer M\n",
      "will need support from a family therapist to help her with challenges from X. Steps\n",
      "are already underway to identify such a therapist.\n",
      "241. In respect of what the children should be told, Dr Berelowitz said that the children\n",
      "need to be advised in terms that the court has found that F has made it psychologically\n",
      "impossible for them to relax into a rich and full relationship with M. He said X and Z\n",
      "may also need to be told that the consequence of F’s approach has been that they will\n",
      "find it very difficult to accept the judgment of the court.\n",
      "242. Dr Berelowitz was asked how the children would each be likely to respond to an order\n",
      "for transfer of residence. He advised that there is no data available from any source on\n",
      "outcomes of change of residence. He could speak anecdotally of the cases with which\n",
      "he has been involved, which he thinks are about 20, and he said that in all of those\n",
      "cases all of the children settled more readily than he feared they might. The one case\n",
      "where it did not work was a case in which he had not been involved from the outset.\n",
      "That was a case of the most extreme alienation that he had come across where the\n",
      "child had no contact with their father for five years. In another case where he knows\n",
      "that the transfer did not work that was due to undermining by the other parent. In that\n",
      "case there were secret telephones and secret meetings at school and a phone was even\n",
      "found under the child’s pillow.\n",
      "DECISION\n",
      "243. For all the reasons analysed herein, and taking account of the children’s welfare as my\n",
      "paramount consideration, I have therefore concluded that Option 3 is the option that is\n",
      "in the children’s best interests and that the children should transfer to live with M as\n",
      "soon as possible.\n",
      "244. I have therefore made the children subject of a child arrangements order whereby they\n",
      "shall live with M, with a period of protective separation of three months from F. At\n",
      "the time of writing, the transfer appears to have been effected smoothly and without\n",
