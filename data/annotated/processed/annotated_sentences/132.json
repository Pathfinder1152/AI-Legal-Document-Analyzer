Mr Harding contends that there is no need to look beyond  Morrison for the purposes of deciding the present case, but in any event the further  authorities upon which M r Clarke relie s do not assist  the Claimant , and indeed , in  common with the outcome in Morrison , point to the conclusion that the claim fail s.  5.
