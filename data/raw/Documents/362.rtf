 and should be struck out.  The strike out application does not involve difficult questions of family law.  This court is well able to consider the evidence and apply the relevant legal principles.  9)  Second, a tran}{\f0\insrsid16336478 sfer
 of the proceedings to the Family D}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809 ivision will inevitably lead to a protraction of the proceedings and in all likelihood to }{\f0\insrsid11300788 yet }{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809 
further adjournments, changes of representation and to further massive wastage of costs.  10) Third, this court is the appropriate court to determine the costs of the application for the Freezing Injunction.}{\f0\insrsid16336478 
  That application was made to}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809  a judge of t}{\f0\insrsid16336478 he Queen\rquote s Bench D}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809 ivision, and this court is familiar with the principles governing such application}{

\f0\insrsid16336478 , if transferred to the Family D}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809 ivision will have to be completely re-constituted and reformulated.  As presently constituted, the proceedings w}{\f0\insrsid16336478 
ould make no more sense in the Family D}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809 ivision than they do here.  There are particulars of claim in which the only relief sought}{\f0\insrsid16336478  (}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809 apart from the setting a
side of the order of Mrs Justice }{\f0\insrsid13921819 Baron}{\f0\insrsid16336478 )}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809  is for repayment of costs}{\f0\insrsid16336478 ,}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809  despite the fact that Mrs Justice }{
\f0\insrsid13921819 Baron}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809  did not order Mrs Harrison to pay Mr Harrison\rquote s costs.  The appropriate course if Mrs Harrison was still intent on bringing proceedings challenging Mrs Justice }{\f0\insrsid13921819 
Baron}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809 \rquote s order would be for her to }{\f0\insrsid16336478 bring fresh proceedings in the Family D}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809 ivision in the proper form, seeking the proper relief.  }{
\f0\insrsid16336478 Those Family D}{\f0\insrsid8157202\charrsid9460809 ivision proceedings should be in the form of an application for permission to appeal out of time.  13)
  Fifth, it was Mrs Harrison and her advisors who decided to bring proceedings in the Queen\rquote s Bench Division in the first place, presumably because they perceived some tactical }{\f0\insrsid12998110\charrsid9460809 
advantage in doing so.  The court should be slow to }{\f0\insrsid11300788 accede}{\f0\insrsid12998110\charrsid9460809  to an application by
 her to remove the proceedings from her chosen division as a means of pre-empting the impending strike-out application\rquote .}{\f0\insrsid15231264\charrsid9460809

The husband has told me that he has hopes of success.  He has invested some \'a3
318,000 of family money since December 2000 and I do not consider that he would have done so unless he had expectations of future worth.  In fairness to the wife, I do not think that it would be proper to ignore the monies that he has in
vested to date.  Accordingly, I propose to }{\f0\insrsid10697038 add}{\f0\insrsid9700167\charrsid9700167  this figure into the asset schedule.  By so doing, I am very conscious that it is not real money and tha}{\f0\insrsid15468694

The quantum of the claim of Mrs Harrison and the extent of the Freezing Order were the subject of paragraphs 39 to 44 inclusive of the skeleton argument.  Paragraphs 43 and 44 were concerned with what was said to be the worth of Mr Harrison\rquote 
s assets in 2005 and 2006, not as at July 2002.  The other paragraphs were in these terms;

 During their marriage the claimant and the defendant set up home and businesses in various countries.  At pres
ent the claimant cannot say whether the defendant retains personal assets or business interests outside the jurisdiction, but it is a distinct possibility.  40)  The claimant\rquote s application is for an order freezing the defendant\rquote 
s assets up to a value of \'a32- million.  This figure is proposed taking into account 1) the substantial costs which the claimant paid in the ancillary relief proceedings and of which she claims repayment in thi}{\f0\insrsid7492116

 is set aside. 41)  As to the costs element, Mrs Justice }{\f0\insrsid13921819 Baron}{\f0\insrsid600228\charrsid9460809  records in her judgment that the costs estimates available at trial in July 2002, showed that the claimant had expended \'a3

The statement that Mrs Harrison had been ordered to pay Mr Harrison\rquote s costs of the ancillary relief proceedings was just plain wrong.  It appears that Mr Justice Butterfield was seriously misled at the hearin

 Mr Justice Butterfield should not have been invited to freeze the assets of Interchange as it was not a party to the application, and it should not have been suggested to him that it was appropriate to omit the usual provision in a freezing order permitt
ing the carrying on of ordinary business.

 an application for a Freezing Order should never have been sought because Mrs Harrison had no proper claim to have the }{\f0\insrsid13921819 Baron}{\f0\insrsid4402361  Order set aside.  Moreover, the m
aking of an application for a Freezing Order was accompanied by serious failures of frankness and disclosure on the part of Mrs Harrison.  Indeed it is difficult to imagine more serious failures.  Almost nothing was done which should have been done and Mr
 Justice Butterfield was given incorrect information on important matters, including what could be seen from the bank statements of the RBS account, the significance of the alleged break-in to the conclusions of Mrs Justice }{\f0\insrsid13921819 Baron}{
\f0\insrsid4402361  and the order for costs which she made.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid4402361 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 83.\tab}Regrettably, the application made to}{\f0\insrsid13114358  Mr }{\f0\insrsid4402361 
Justice Butterfield was a travesty of an application for a Freezing Order.  The motivation for the making of the application is a matter of speculation.  There was no evidence to justify the conclusi
on that there was a risk of dissipation by Mr Harrison of his assets, even assuming that Mrs}{\f0\insrsid13114358  Harrison had an arguable cause}{\f0\insrsid4402361  of action for the setting aside of the }{\f0\insrsid13921819 Baron}{\f0\insrsid4402361 
 Order.  The way in which the figure of \'a32 million was arrived at seems to be}{\f0\insrsid13114358 ,}{\f0\insrsid4402361  at best}{\f0\insrsid13114358 ,}{\f0\insrsid4402361  casual, increasing by 100% between the drafting of the application and}{
\f0\insrsid13114358  the}{\f0\insrsid4402361  hearing before Mr Justice Butterfield.  The inclusion of the assets of Interchange and the deliberate decision not to include in the order the usual provision for transactions in th
e ordinary course of business, are suggestive of a desire to inflict at least pressure}{\f0\insrsid12722995 ,}{\f0\insrsid4402361  if not actual damage}{\f0\insrsid12722995 ,}{\f0\insrsid4402361  on Mr Harrison.

 necessary for me to reach any conclusion as to what motivated the making of the applicat}{\f0\insrsid12722995 ion for the Freezing Injunction. I}{\f0\insrsid4402361 
t is enough that the making of that application was not justified and that the manner in which the application was made was seriously irregular.

  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for me t
