In the subsequent remedies hearing the Tribunal made an award of compensation of \'a326,118.13 which included an award of \'a3

and the employee cannot claim that the conduct which brought about his resignation constitutes an independent detriment justifying a separate and independent claim to compensation under section 47B.

The new computer system had been the subject of much debate and deliberation within the school.  An ICT project group had been set up to implement a strategic plan which had obtained the approval of the school governors.  There were various m
eetings of that group between May 2002 and June 2003.  It is common ground that the Claimant became involved with that group.  He was not a formally constituted member but he was technically proficient, was very well versed in ICT matters,
 and was motivated, as was recognised by the School, to try and ensure that the system adopted was appropriate.

The Claimant expressed concerns that security issues were not being satisfactorily addressed.  The proposed strategy involved consolidating four separate netw

 others
 preferred Microsoft Windows.  That system was ultimately chosen because it was thought that pupils would be more likely to use it in their homes.  It was also, however, thought appropriate to have a security system and the measure adopted was known as

It was believed that this would restrict access by pupils to the computers being used by staff.  This was not in fact the Claimant\rquote s preferred method of security; he would have chosen the physical segregation of

When the new system was being installed in the summer holidays of 2003 it transpired that the 
state of the cabling was different than had been anticipated.  It had been thought that there had been separate cabling of the student and staff networks.  In fact, however, it was discovered that there were already just one set of cabling for both.  So t
h
e head of the project group, Mr Marsden, took the decision not to implement the virtual LAN segregation at all.  He reasoned that there had been no security breaches even when the networks were physically inter-related and, therefore, some lesser form of 
security would suffice.  He considered that password security would be adequate.

The Claimant was informed about this when he returned to school on 1 September 2003.  He was concerned that the security protection was inadequate.  He wished to demonstrate
 the inadequacy of the system.  Accordingly, on 5 September, he went to the learning centre and used a PC to which students will have access and adopted a technique which enabled him to gain access to the encrypted passwords for the PC
 and then save them to a floppy disc which he could take away.  He said that this task took him no more than 10 minutes.

 on that day, 5 September, he told Mr Edmundson that he was attempting to gain access to the system in order to test security and to demonstrate what he perceived to be its failings.  Mr Edmu

The Tribunal also found that there were somewhat ambiguous instructions as to whether or not staff could test the system.  Apparently, it had happened on occasions
 in the past.  Armed with a floppy disc which he had acquired on 5 September, the Claimant set about decoding the passwords

On 9 September Mr Brooker carried out an investigation.  He interviewed various people including Mr Fox and Mr Humphreys and he called the

ndson who confirmed that he did indeed know that the Claimant was intending to test the system in order to establish its security vulnerability.  Mr Edmundson did not however believe that
 he had authority to give specific approval for these actions but he accepted that the Claimant might have thought otherwise.  Mr Humphreys accepted that he had given implicit approval by not stopping the Claimant from carrying out the tests.  Dr Watson c
onsidered that it was desirable that the tests should be carried out by somebody outside a technical team in order to make it sufficiently rigorous.  Mr Leigh-Bramwell also obtained notes from his discussions with members of staff bu
t they were not shown to the Claimant at the Appeal.

On the following day Mr Brooker invited the Claimant to discuss matters further but the Claimant took the view that his position was untenable and he resigned, as we have said,
 on 2 October.  He felt he had been victimized for highlighting security concerns and he was aggrieved that the school had focu

inally, the School denied that there had been any dismissal at all.  It was denied that the disciplina

ccordingly, although the Tribunal accepted that the warning had been given because of his having hacked into the computer, that amounted in the Tribunal\rquote s view to a protected disclosure.  The employers had
 acted in breach of the duty of trust and confidence by acting as they did; the subsequent resignation of the Claimant, therefore,
 amounted to a dismissal.    The Tribunal also held that independently of the protected disclosure provisions, the dismissal was unfair under general principles of unfair dismissal law. The procedures had been inadequate. Although the School
 genuinely believed the Claimant had committed an act of misconduct, it did not reasonably hold that belief after having carried out a reasonable investigation.  It did however, find that the Claimant had been less than wholly frank with Mr Edmu

n our view this submission is premised on a false assessment of what the Tribunal in fact found.  The Claimant did not merely tell Mr Edmundson that he was going to break into the system; he also told him \endash  which w
ould have been obvious in any event - that it was because of his concerns that the system which had in fact been adopted was insecure and would too readily lead to unauthorized disclosures.  (See paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Decision.)  He also told Mr 
Edmundson and the Headmaster, after the event, what he had done.  That of course involved not merely informing them that he had broken into the system but perhaps more pertinently, as far as protected disclosure is concerned, that the system had been 
broken into.

grounds of a protected disclosure and, in order to succeed with his unfair dismissal case, that the protected disclosure was the reason or the main reason for his dismissal.  The respondent argues that he had been 
dismissed not because he had disclosed matters of public interest but, rather, because he had without authority hack
ed into the computer system.  The Tribunal reminds itself that the statutory scheme introduced b the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 is to encourage disclosures to be made internally , that is to say, to the whistleblower\rquote 
s own employer and that this i
s achieved by making protection readily available so long as the worker raises his or her concern with the employer. Prior to the enactment of the Public Interest Disclosure Act, a Worker who blew the whistle could expect to feel the full force of an orga
n
isation's disapproval by way of ostracism, criticism, poor appraisals, victimisation and even dismissal. The Tribunal is therefore acutely conscious of the policy behind the Public Interest Disclosure Act.  Parliament, when framing the legislation, requir
e
d an employer to have a reasonable belief in the matters being disclosed. This requirement was inserted in order to achieve a fair balance between the interests of the worker who suspects malpractice and those of an employer who could be damaged by unfoun
ded allegations. It seems to us that it would emasculate the public policy behind the legislation for us to}{\fs8  }{
accept the respondent's submission that the claimant was the subject of disciplinary action not because he had blown the whistle on a suspected failu
re to comply with the legal obligation but rather because he had hacked into the respondent's computer system without authority. To allow an employer to defeat a Public Interest Disclosure Act case in this way would be to drive a coach and horses through 
t
he intention of the legislature that whistleblowers should have employment protection.  Doubtless, had the claimant approached Mr Edmundson, Mr Brooker or anyone else for that matter, and simply said that he had a belief that the security system was inade
q
uate, and had he been subject to disciplinary action and brought a similar complaint as he now does, the respondent would have sought to argue that he did not have the basis for a reasonable belief. The respondent cannot have it  both ways. In order to ob
t
ain sufficient evidence to found a reasonable belief, the Claimant had to do more than simply express misgivings about what had happened over the summer of 2003. It is our view that the legislation must be construed purposively and the investigation under
taken by the employee to found his reasonable belief should not be divorced from the disclosure itself.

Mr Chaudhari submits that the Tribunal erred in law here because the protected act is limited the disclosure itself and does not extend to any conduct which is designed to demonstrate that the belief is reasonable.  He says that to 
permit conduct of this nature to be considered part of the disclosure would enable employees to go on a fishing expedition to seek to find evidence to justify suspicions and thereby establish a reasonable belief.

On this point we prefer the arguments of the School.  We consider that the Tribunal did fall into error in this part of its decision.  The statute protects disclosure but not other conduct by the employee even if connected in some way to that disclosure (

The Tribunal sought to justify its conclusion on policy grounds.  It observed that if the Claimant had simply noted that the security system was inadequate and had 
been disciplined then the employers would have said that he had no reasonable grounds for his belief.  The point is, however, it seems to us, tha
t if he had done simply that there is no reason to suppose that he would have been subject to any disciplinary sanction at all.  And even if he had, the law only protects him if he has reasonable grounds for his belief.  It does not allow him to commit wh
at would otherwise be acts of misconduct in the hope that he may be able to establish the justification for his belief.

An employee cannot be entitled to break into his employer\rquote s filing cabinet in the hope of finding papers which will demonstrate some relevant 
wrongdoing which he can then disclose to the appropriate person. He is liable to be disciplined for such conduct, and that is so whether he turns up such papers or not.  Provided that his misconduct is genuinely the reason for the disciplinary acti
on, the employee will not be protected even if he does in fact discover incriminating papers.  
Success does not retrospectively provide a cloak of immunity for his actions, although he will then of course be protected with respect to the subsequent disclosure of the information itself.

We think there are two quite separate issues here.  First, the conduct designed to demonstrate that the belief was reasonable and, second, the disclosur
e of the information itself which tended to show a breach of the relevant legal obligation.  Putting it simply, it seems to us that the law }{protects the disclosure of information which the employee reasonably believes
 tends to demonstrate the kind of wrongdoing, or anticipated wrongdoing, which is covered by section 43B. It does not protect the actions of the employee which are directed 
to establishing or confirming the reasonableness of that belief. The protection is for the whistleblower who reasonably believes, to put it colloquially if inaccurately, that something is wrong, not the investigator who seeks either 
to establish that it is wrong or to show that his concerns are reasonable.

 section 98 both because of procedural failings and because it was a breach of trust and confidence for the employer to have disciplined the employee in the circumstances, given that contrary to the School\rquote s understanding, he was in fact authoris

Mr Chaudhuri says that the Tribunal\rquote s reasoning canno
t now be sustained if there is no breach of section 47B.  We think that is right.  That is not to say that the Tribunal could not properly reach the conclusion that there was a constructive dismissal.  It could have come to that conclusion,
 it seems to us, by considering all the circumstances of the case,
 but it has established the constructive dismissal by focusing specifically on the fact that there was a protected disclosure.  We do not think it is possible to say with complete confidence that a Tribunal
 would necessarily have reached the same result had it not focused on the protected disclosure and it seems to us, therefore, that the appropriate step to take now is to remit the matter for findings on that particular issue only.
