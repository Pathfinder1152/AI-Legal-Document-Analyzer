\rquote s two brothers, possibly with the help of others, accessed a server in an office which they shared with Mr Imerman and copied information and documents which Mr Imerman had stored there.
 From that material they printed out eleven files and handed them to their solicitor, Mr Zaiwalla, who arranged for a barrister to sift the documents for those in respect of which it was thought Mr Imerman could claim legal professional privilege, which r
esulted in seven files of documents. Mr Zaiwalla then passed those files on to Withers, the solicitors acting for Mrs Imerman in her divorce, who had already issued Form A, giving notice of Mrs Imerman\rquote 
s intention to seek ancillary financial relief. Withers then sent copies of the seven files to the solicitors acting for Mr Imerman in the divorce proceedings.

s Bench Division against the defendants who had gained access to Mr Imerman\rquote s documents stored on the server, Eady 
J on 27 July 2009 restrained the defendants from communicating or disclosing to third parties (including Mrs Imerman and Withers) any information contained in the documents and from copying or using any of the documents or information contained therein. H
e also required the defendants to hand over all copies of the documents to Mr Imerman. The defendants appeal.

Mr Imerman sought the return of the seven files, and any copies made of them, and an order enjoining Mrs Imerman and Withers from using any of the 
information obtained therefrom. On 9 November 2009 Moylan J decided that the seven files should be handed back to Mr Imerman for the purpose of enabling him to remove any material for which he claimed privilege, but that Mr Imerman would then have to retu
r
n the remainder of the seven files to Mrs Imerman for use by her in connection with the matrimonial proceedings. Mr Imerman appeals against that decision. Mrs Imerman cross-appeals against the decision, seeking (a) more control over the process by which M
r Imerman can assert privilege, and (b) a reversal of Moylan J\rquote s refusal to restrain Mr Imerman from disposing of certain memory sticks.

\rquote s right to protect
 the confidentiality of the documents stored on the server and to impose sanctions for unlawful breaches of that right and the need to ensure that a just resolution of the ancillary relief proceedings is achieved on the basis of a truthful and comprehensi
ve identification of the parties\rquote  assets. In short, Mrs Imerman contends that the law which protects Mr Imerman\rquote 
s confidential information and documents should yield to the need to ensure that he cannot escape his true liability by concealing his assets. Th
e law should, she says, recognise her right to truthful disclosure, even if that can only be achieved by unlawful methods. Feared dishonesty justifies self-help, even where that self-help is unlawful. Moylan J acknowledged this, Eady J did not. If the def
e
ndants acted unlawfully, we have to consider whether the special rules in matrimonial proceedings for determining the assets on the basis of which relief is given, and the special role of the court in that process of identification, justify the unlawful m
easures (described, in an attempt to disarm, as \lquote self-help\rquote ) taken to obtain the information and documents.

The issues thrown up by these arguments are significant, both as a matter of principle and in practice. They require consideration of the law of conf
idence, both in general and as between husband and wife; the power of the court to exclude or admit wrongfully obtained documents and information; and the proper attitude which the court, and lawyers advising parties, should adopt in ancillary relief proc
e
edings when one of the parties is, or may be, concealing assets, or when the other party may have unlawfully obtained documents which may reveal such assets. While these issues involve domestic points of equity, common law, civil procedure, and statutory 
construction, articles 6, 8, and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (in summary terms, the right to a fair trial, the right to respect for privacy, and the right to freedom of speech, respectively) are also engaged.

in relation to ancillary relief proceedings, in order to express ourselves clearly and simply, we will do so on the basis that it is the wife who is seeking ancillary relief from the husband. While that is normally the case, it is not infrequent, and we s
uspect it will become more frequent, that husbands seek ancillary relief from wives. Sometimes, each may seek ancillary relief from the other.

Vivian Imerman and Elizabeth Tchenguiz were married in 2001; it was a second marriage for each of them. Shortly before the marriage, Mr Imerman accepted an invitation from his prospective brothers in law, Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz, to share their

{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname PostalCode}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname Street}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname address}}35 Park Lane{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
. From 2003 to February 2009, Mr Imerman, together with his employees, enjoyed free use of the office space at Leconfield House (\'93the Office\'94
), and free use of the computer system serving the Office, the system being linked to that serving Vincent Tchenguiz\rquote s office in Park Lane. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 10.\tab}Mr Imerman had his own password-protected computer (although the efficacy of the prot
ection appears to have been dubious) and his own email account, and he, and his employees, used his computer for his personal and business purposes, including in connection with companies in which he had a substantial interest and with his family trusts. 
As he knew, his computer was supported by a server (including a separate back-up system), to which we shall refer generically as \'93the server\'94
. Both the Office and the server were owned or leased by Robert Tchenguiz, who therefore in practice had unrestricte
d access to the server. It appears likely that Vincent Tchenguiz also had unrestricted access to the server, which served his office IT system as well. Both Robert and Victor Tchenguiz were and are in a substantial way of business, and Mr and Mrs Imerman 
each appears to have been independently rich.

Mrs Imerman petitioned for divorce on 30 December 2008. Some seven weeks later, Mr Imerman was evicted from the Office by Robert Tchenguiz. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 12.\tab}Meanwhile, on about nine occasions, between 6 January and 24 February 
2009, unknown to Mr Imerman, Robert Tchenguiz, with the possible involvement of Mr McClean (the principal IT manager of R20 Ltd, a company owned by Robert Tchenguiz and operating out of Leconfield House), and Mr Obayda (an IT manager employed by R20 Ltd),
 
accessed the server and made electronic copies of emails and other documents stored by Mr Imerman on his computer, and hence on the server. He then took further copies of this material on various digital storage media, including two USB memory sticks and 
o
ne hard drive. The precise extent of the material involved is a matter of dispute, but it appears to have been vast, the equivalent of between 250,000 and 2.5m pages. Vincent Tchenguiz was aware of what was going on, and was shown copies of some of the ma
terial.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 13.\tab}
The sole reason, or at any rate the main reason, which Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz advance for accessing Mr Imerman\rquote s records was their concern for their sister\rquote 
s interests. This concern is said to have arisen from threats which Mr Imerman had, on the Tchenguiz brothers\rquote 
 evidence, made to Mrs Imerman and to her brothers, on a number of occasions from the autumn of 2007, that his assets would be concealed in any ancillary relief proceedings. Thus, albeit often in fairly friendly, or even jocular, con
versations, Mr Imerman is said to have stated that the Tchenguiz family or Mrs Imerman would \'93never be able to find my money\'94, because it was \'93well hidden\'94. These observations appear to have been made in the context of the Imermans\rquote 
 marriage \'93living on borrowed time\'94 from the middle of June 2007, according to Mrs Imerman\rquote 
s evidence. Having moved out of the matrimonial home in autumn 2007, Mr Imerman returned in spring 2008, but the marriage irrevocably ended at the end of that year, when, according to Mrs I
merman, she discovered that he had been having an affair with his former wife. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 14.\tab}The Tchenguiz brothers\rquote 
 concern is said to have been reinforced by their belief that Mr Imerman\rquote s temporary return to the matrimonial home in spring 2008 had been motivated by 
a desire to improve his position in relation to any ancillary relief proceedings. They also point to what Mr Imerman said in a subsequent telephone conversation with, and recorded by, Vincent Tchenguiz, on 28 February 2009, but that was, of course, after 
the last occasion on which they gained access to Mr Imerman\rquote s computer records. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 15.\tab}
It appears that, within a short time of their having been made, many, if not all, of the electronic recordings of the material obtained from Mr Imerman\rquote s computer records on the server were handed over to the Tchenguiz brothers\rquote 
 solicitor, Mr Zaiwalla, who passed the two USB memory sticks and hard drive to forensic accountants, in order to prepare a report. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 16.\tab} A significant quantity of this material, consisting of those documents
 which were thought to be of particular relevance to Mrs Imerman in any ancillary relief proceedings, were printed out and handed over in eleven lever arch files to Mr Zaiwalla, who instructed a barrister to examine them and remove any documents in respec
t of which it appeared that Mr Imerman could claim privilege. This exercise was carried out on 9 February 2009, and the remaining documents (\'93the seven files\'94
) were collated in seven lever arch files, which were copied and passed on to Withers, the solicitors acting for Mrs Imerman in her divorce, who had already given notice of Mrs Imerman\rquote 
s initiation of ancillary relief proceedings. On 18 February 2009, Withers sent copies of the seven files to Ms Hughes of Hughes Fowler Carruthers, the solicitors acting for Mr Imerman in the divorce proceedings.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 17.\tab}
Ms Hughes had initiated contact with Ms Parker of Withers in connection with the divorce proceedings more than seven weeks earlier, on 5 January 2009, when she asked to be \'93provide[d] with all }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\insrsid10386681\charrsid6257728 Hildebrand}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681  documents\'94. Ms Parker replied a week later, raising various points, including a reciprocal request for \'93}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\insrsid10386681\charrsid6257728 Hildebrand}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681  documents\'94, and a statement that she would issue a Form A application raising Mrs Imerman\rquote s ancillary relief claims. The correspondence continued with
 each solicitor seeking assurances that there would be no disposal or concealment of assets by the other\rquote 
s client. In a letter of 22 January 2009, Ms Parker made reference to specific assets of Mr Imerman, presumably as a result of what she had been told b
y Mrs Imerman, based on information she had been given by Robert Tchenguiz following perusal of some of the material obtained from the server. This caused Ms Hughes to ask, in a letter written the following day, \'93
precisely how [Ms Parker had come] by this information, most of which is not a matter of public record\'94. In the same letter, Ms Hughes wrote that Mr Imerman \'93will provide a most helpful and full Form E\'94
, and expressed the hope that Mrs Imerman would reciprocate. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 18.\tab}Ms Parker did not answer Ms Hughes\rquote 
s request in the 23 January letter, so it was repeated by Ms Hughes on 30 January 2009. In fact, no answer was given to this request until 18 February 2009, when the copies of the seven files were sent to Ms Hughes. This led to an indignant letter from Ms
 Hughes, seeking a full explanation as to how the material in the seven files had been obtained and threatening proceedings. Ms Parker replied the next day, 27 February 2009, explaining that neither Withers nor Mrs Imerman had \'93
commission[ed or] participate[d] in the process by which the third party who obtained these documents did so\'94, and \'93reject[ing the] assertion that the action by which they were so obtained was illegal\'94
. Ms Parker also stated that she had disclosed copies of all the seven files with which she had been furnished.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 19.\tab}
Meanwhile, on 26 February 2009, Mr Imerman issued proceedings against Robert and Viincent Tchenguiz, Mr McClean, Mr Obayda, and Mr Zaiwalla (\'93the four defendants\'94) in the Queen\rquote s Bench Division. Various interlocutory application
s and orders were made restraining the defendants from using information obtained from the documents. In particular, an interlocutory injunction was granted by Eady J on 20 March 2009 restraining the handing over to Mrs Imerman or Withers of a report prep
ared by the forensic accountants based on information obtained from the documents made available to them through Mr Zaiwalla. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 20.\tab}For present purposes, the application of central importance in the Queen\rquote 
s Bench proceedings is an application heard by Eady J in June 2009. It was Mr Imerman\rquote 
s application for summary judgment for orders precluding each of the defendants from communicating or disclosing to third parties (including Mrs Imerman and Withers) any information contained in the documents, restraining the d
efendants from copying or using any of the documents or information contained therein, and requiring the defendants to hand over all copies of the documents to Mr Imerman. In a reserved judgment on 27 July 2009, after a three day hearing, Eady J acceded t
o that application. The first appeal before us is the defendants\rquote  challenge to that decision, pursuant to permission granted by this court.  
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 21.\tab}
During this period, the ancillary relief proceedings were getting under way in the Family Division. Mrs Imerman had
 issued her Form A application, and various disputes and interlocutory applications ensued. Of particular relevance for present purposes is an application by Mr Imerman, made as \-a result of a refusal of Ms Hughes\rquote 
s request to Ms Parker for the return of the seven files. This application was for return of the seven files, and any copies made thereof, and for an order enjoining Mrs Imerman and Withers from using any of the information obtained therefrom.

s application came on before Moylan J in N
ovember 2009, who, after a three day hearing, gave judgment on 11 December 2009, which is the other decision challenged before us. He delivered a supplemental judgment on 13 January 2010. He decided that the seven files should be handed back to Mr Imerman
 
for the purpose of enabling him to remove any material for which he claimed privilege, but that Mr Imerman would then have to return the remainder of the seven files to Mrs Imerman for use by her in connection with the matrimonial proceedings. With the pe
rmission of this court, Mr Imerman appeals against that decision. Mrs Imerman cross-appeals against the decision, seeking (a) more control over the process by which Mr Imerman can assert privilege, and (b) a reversal of Moylan J\rquote 
s refusal to restrain Mr Imerman from disposing of certain memory sticks.

, as stated by Lord Brandon of Oakbrook (page 438), is that both parties to ancillary relief proceedings are under a continuing \'93duty to the court to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts to the other party and the court.\'94
  Or, as he put it (page 436), \'93they must provide the court with information about all the circumstances of the case \'85 and ensure that the information provided is correct, complete and up to date\'94
. This reflects the fact that section 25(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 requires the court \'93to have regard to all the circumstances of the case\'94, from which it follows, as Lord Brandon observed (page 440), that \'93
unless the parties make full and frank disclosure of all material matters, the court cannot lawfully or properly exercise [its] discretion [under sections 23 and 24 of the Act].\'94
 It is worth remembering that what the wife had failed to disclose in that case, and what led to the setting aside of the consent ancillary relief order by the House of Lords, was the fact of her intended remarriage, not some failure to give proper disc

\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 In relation to these Rules we make t
wo general observations. First, that the Rules do not provide for any disclosure of information or disclosure (discovery) of documents until a spouse has lodged his Form E. Second, and even more significantly, that the process of disclosure (discovery) of
 
documents both then and thereafter is closely regulated by the Rules and, in accordance with the Rules, by the court. Although there is a general and continuing duty to make full disclosure of all relevant information, there is, despite the duty imposed o
n
 the court by section 25 of the 1973 Act, no duty of general disclosure (discovery) of documents of the kind required in ordinary civil proceedings by the Civil Procedure Rules. And whereas in ordinary civil proceedings the parties can normally choose wha
t documentary evidence to tender, it is the court which controls what documents are to be disclosed and tendered by way of evidence in ancillary relief proceedings.

But two features of ancillary relief proceedings have led to the Family Courts refusing to condemn, still less to impose any sanction (save very occasionally in particularly egregious circumstances), when a spouse obtains and copies the other spouse
\rquote s documents, even though they are confidential, provided, according to the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 Hildebrand }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 
rules, that no force is used. First, the necessity to adopt self-help arise
s, it is said, from persistent lack of candour in proceedings for ancillary relief and the frequent adoption of underhand means to salt away assets from the gaze of the court and thus avoid a fair division. If the courts refuse to permit pre-emptive acqui
s
ition of information relevant to a just resolution of a claim for ancillary relief, they will, it is said, licence the other party to cheat and conceal. Second, and as we have described, the court is under the statutory obligation imposed by section 25 to
 investigate and discover the true extent of  the parties\rquote  finances, a role described by Thorpe LJ as \'93quasi-inquisitorial\'94: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 Parra v Parra }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

 that the questionnaire was not a genuine attempt to obtain information of which he was ignorant.

i
n any event when she serves her Questionnaire. Disclosure in this way of the fact of what she has done is not in any way inconsistent with the Rules. And it is no answer to this obligation that it may prompt the husband immediately to commence proceedings
 
for recovery of the original documents and any copies. The qualification we have mentioned arises in this way. Although the point had not been canvassed in argument, Mr Turner, in response to our draft judgment, helpfully raised the question whether a wif
e
 would not be able to rely upon the privilege against incrimination in relation to any criminal conduct. We have heard no argument on the point. We make clear, however, that nothing we have said is intended to deny a wife in such circumstances whatever re
course to the privilege against incrimination she would otherwise be entitled to. We add only this. Although there may be cases where a wife will be entitled to plead the privilege so as not to have to disclose }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

that she has such documents. Moreover, a wife who wishes to deploy such documents against her husband cannot rely upon the privilege as a reason for n
ot disclosing the fact that she has them at the time when such disclosure would otherwise be required by the rule in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681\charrsid8023698 Hildebrand}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

My feeling is that, if the wife gives an account of her husband which includes any past financial dishonesty, whether to herself or to a third party, or recounts any threat or statement by him such as reasonably leads to the conc

In the substantive ancillary relief proceedings, Wilson J held that the wife had rightly anticipated her husband\rquote s failure to disclose his true financial position.  Accordingly, he held that it was \'93reasonable\'94
 for her to take such photocopies as she could obtain without the use of force and to scour the dustbin. But he described as \'93unacceptable\'94 and \'93reprehensible\'94
 her use of force, interception of mail and retention of original documents (page 1085d-f). He declined to regard that behaviour as relevant to the amount of the award although it would be relevant to costs.

 need to be tested for compatibility with principles in other areas of law, including in particular the law of tort. As a family lawyer of practical dispositio
n, I have some confidence that, in the appropriate case, they will withstand that test. If the spouse (say a wife) who, in circumstances of reasonable doubt as to her husband\rquote 
s willingness to comply with his duties of disclosure to the court, borrows such 
of his documents as he has appeared to be content to leave accessible to her without her need to resort to force, would the notion of a licence negate any conclusion, if otherwise apt, that she had thereby committed a trespass or conversion in respect of 
t
hose documents? Or would the law prefer to recognise a public policy exception to the ordinary laws of trespass to chattels and/or conversion of them? Such an exception would be founded on the words of s 25(1) and (2) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, w
hich, exceptionally, confer upon the court a duty to despatch certain litigation, namely applications for ancillary relief, with regard to certain factors, namely to a \lquote first consideration\rquote 
 (the welfare of any relevant child while a minor), to the \lquote matters\rquote  specified in subs (2) and, more widely, to \lquote all the circumstances of the case\rquote 
. Unsurprisingly the financial resources of each spouse are the first of the specified \lquote matters\rquote . Thus, if the family court fails to have regard to the financial resources of ea
ch spouse as they truly are, or at least as it can reasonably discern them to be, it fails to discharge its duty. The family court is therefore required by Parliament to be furnished with true information about the parties\rquote 
 resources, whatever (within the rule of law, appropriately drawn) be the source from which it has been collected \'85 
\par [84]  \tab I would be profoundly opposed to a co-existence of the admissibility in the family courts of documents secretly obtained with, nevertheless, a tortious liability on 
the part of those who had obtained them or who shared responsibility for their having been obtained. Such a co-existence would compromise the ability of family practitioners to advise that action on the part of their clients in accordance with the }{

 in accordance with the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681\charrsid11298054 Hildebrand}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681  \lquote rules\rquote  \lquote is to take a risk\rquote ; or to state, as he does, at [58] above, that

The law of confidence was developed by the Courts of Chancery over the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Typically, a claim for breach of co
nfidence arose in the commercial context, and in circumstances where there was no question but that the defendant was entitled to have obtained the information concerned initially. Thus, in perhaps the most familiar and frequent category of case, involvin
g
 trade secrets and the like, the claimant himself will have provided the defendant with the information, as, at the relevant time, the defendant will have been an employee or agent of the claimant. In such cases, the claimant cannot allege that the defend
a
nt is not entitled to have the information, let alone complain that he did anything legally wrong or morally culpable to obtain the information in the first place. What the claimant could do was to complain if the defendant made illicit copies of confiden
tial papers or misused the information for his own, rather than his principal\rquote s, purposes.

e. The notion that looking at documents which one knows to be confidential is itself capable of constituting an actionable wrong (albeit perhaps only in equity) is also consistent with the decision of the Strasbourg court that monitoring private telephone
 calls can infringe the article 8 rights of the caller: see }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 Copland v United Kingdom }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 (2007) 25 BHRC 216.

In our view, it would be a breach of confidence for a defendant, without the authority of the claimant, to examine, or to make, retain, or supply copies
 to a third party of, a document whose contents are, and were (or ought to have been) appreciated by the defendant to be, confidential to the claimant. It is of the essence of the claimant\rquote 
s right to confidentiality that he can choose whether, and, if so, 
to whom and in what circumstances and on what terms, to reveal the information which has the protection of the confidence. It seems to us, as a matter of principle, that, again in the absence of any defence on the particular facts, a claimant who establis
h
es a right of confidence in certain information contained in a document should be able to restrain any threat by an unauthorised defendant to look at, copy, distribute any copies of, or to communicate, or utilise the contents of the document (or any copy)
,
 and also be able to enforce the return (or destruction) of any such document or copy. Without the court having the power to grant such relief, the information will, through the unauthorised act of the defendant, either lose its confidential character, or
 will at least be at risk of doing so. The claimant should not be at risk, through the unauthorised act of the defendant, of having the confidentiality of the information lost, or even potentially lost.

If a defendant looks at a document to which he has no right of access and which contains information which is confidential to the claimant, it would be surprising if the claimant could not obtain an injunction to stop the defendant repeating 
his action, if he threatened to do so. The fact that the defendant did not intend to reveal the contents to any third party would not meet the claimant\rquote 
s concern: first, given that the information is confidential, the defendant should not be seeing it; secondly, whatever the defendant\rquote 
s intentions, there would be a risk of the information getting out, for the defendant may change his mind or may inadvertently reveal the information.

 reason otherwise). Without such an order, the information would still be \'93out there\'94
 in the possession of someone who should not have it. The value of the actual paper on which any copying has been made will be tiny, and, where the copy is electronic, the

In this case, at far as we can see, there is no question but that Mr Imerman had an expectation of privacy in r
espect of the majority of his documents stored on the server, so that issue can properly be answered in his favour even at this interlocutory stage. Mr Turner QC, appearing for Mrs Imerman in the Family Division appeal, realistically did not suggest other
w
ise. After all, the very justification offered for the actions of her brothers by Mrs Imerman was the fear that Mr Imerman would seek to maintain the secrecy of the information which she sought by clandestine means. It seems clear that much of the informa
t
ion contained in the documents was, at least in the absence of a good reason to the contrary, confidential to Mr Imerman. Many emails sent to and by and on behalf of Mr Imerman, whether connected with his family or private life, his personal and family as
sets, or his business dealings must be of a private and confidential nature. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 78.\tab}However, at least in the written submissions made on behalf of the defendants in the Queen\rquote 
s Bench Division appeal, it was contended that, until Mr Imerman had specifically identi
fied the documents which contained confidential information, and the grounds for claiming confidentiality, his claim in confidence should be rejected. No authority has been cited to support the proposition that, in every case where it is said that breach 
o
f confidence has occurred, or is threatened, in relation to a number of documents, the claimant must, as a matter of law, identify each and every document for which he claims confidence, and why. In some cases, that may be an appropriate requirement, for 
instance where a claimant is seeking to enjoin a former employee from using some, but not all, of the information the latter obtained when in the claimant\rquote s employment, as in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 
Lock International plc v Beswick }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 [1989] 1 WLR 1268, page 1274B. However, in the pr
esent case, the imposition of such a requirement is unnecessary (as it is obvious that many, probably most, of the documents are confidential or contain confidential information), disproportionate (because of the sheer quantity of documents copied), and u
n
fair on Mr Imerman (in the light of the number of documents copied, and the fact that the copying was done without his knowledge, let alone his consent). It is oppressive and verging on the absurd to suggest that, before he can obtain any equitable relief
, Mr Imerman must identify which out of 250,000 (let alone which out of 2.5 million) documents is or is not confidential or does or does not contain confidential information.

ored on the server, which was, as he knew, owned by Robert Tchenguiz, who enjoyed physically unrestricted access to the server, cannot deprive Mr Imerman of the reasonable expectation of privacy, and the consequent right to maintain a claim for breach of 
confidence, in respect of the contents of any of his documents stored on the server. The fact that a defendant has a means of access to get into a claimant\rquote 
s room or even into his desk does not by any means necessarily lead to the conclusion that he has the right to look at, let alone to copy, or even disseminate, the contents of the claimant\rquote 
s private or confidential documents contained therein. Mr Imerman was a bare licensee of particular rooms in the Office, and may have shared rooms with Robert Tchenguiz
, but that could not possibly mean that Robert Tchenguiz was entitled to look at Mr Imerman\rquote 
s otherwise confidential personal or business papers, just because those papers were kept in those rooms. Confidentiality is not dependent upon locks and keys or their electronic equivalents.

\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 So, and not least in relation to financial matters, English law recognises that although marriage 
may be a partnership of equals there is nonetheless a sphere in which each spouse has, within and as part of the marriage, a life separate and distinct from the shared matrimonial life. This, after all, is what one would expect. It is, moreover, implicit 
in the protection which article 8 affords each spouse in relation to his or her personal and individual private life, in contrast to their shared family life.

t the other in relation to their separate lives and personalities? More specifically, why should one spouse in relation to his or her separate financial affairs and private documents not be able to have recourse as against the other to the kind of equitab
l
e relief which we are here considering? We can think of no satisfactory reason for any such rule and every reason why such relief should in principle be available as between spouses. Is it to be said, for example, that a husband is to be free to borrow an
d
 read what he knows his wife would consider her private diary? Is a wife to be free to borrow and read what she knows her husband would consider his confidential papers (whether relating to his work or to the affairs of his parents or siblings)? Surely no
t
. Subject of course to the court being satisfied that the normal equitable principles would otherwise be in play, a claimant is not to be denied equitable relief merely because the defendant is, or has obtained the material or information in question from
, his or her spouse.

 The submission that there is no confidence as between husband and wife is particularly unacceptable, indeed, deeply unattractive, in circumstances such as arise in this case. The submission invokes the special relationship between h
usband and wife in order to defeat Mr Imerman\rquote 
s claim for confidentiality against her. But it is invoked at a time when that relationship had broken down, for the material was copied after Mrs Imerman had petitioned for divorce and Mr Imerman had left the 
matrimonial home. And it is invoked for the purpose of justifying an action which was and is solely concerned with the financial terms on which the parties are to be divorced.

d, civil partners, or lovers, will often affect the question of whether information contained in certain documents is confidential. We would go along with Mr Browne\rquote 
s submission to the extent of accepting that the fact that the claimant and defendant in co
nfidence proceedings were married at the time of the alleged breach of confidence will often be a relevant factor on the issue of whether the information was confidential as between the two parties. The court may well hold that, as a result of their relat
ionship \endash  what they have said to each other or how they have acted to each other\rquote s knowledge \endash 
 the husband has no right as against his wife (or vice versa) to confidence in relation to particular information which, in the absence of the marriage and the way they conducted themselves, he would otherwise have enjoyed.

The question must, inevitably, depend on the facts of the particular case. Thus, if a husband leaves his bank statement lying around open in the matrimonial home, in the kitchen, living room or m
arital bedroom, it may well lose its confidential character as against his wife. The court may have to consider the nature of the relationship and the way the parties lived, and conducted their personal and business affairs. Thus, if the parties each had 
their own study, it would be less likely that the wife could copy the statement without infringing the husband\rquote s confidence if it had been left by him in his study rather than in the marital bedroom, and the wife\rquote 
s case would be weaker if the statement was 
kept in a drawer in his desk and weaker still if kept locked in his desk. But, as we have already said, confidentiality is not dependent upon locks and keys. Thus the wife might well be able to maintain, as against her husband, the confidentiality of her 
personal diary or journal, even though it was kept visible and unlocked on her dressing table.

But it is important to emphasise that the relationship between the parties and the circumstances in which the information or document is obtained is relevant o
nly to the question as to whether the information or document is to be cloaked with confidentiality. Once it is determined that the document is properly to be regarded as confidential to one spouse but not to the other, the relationship has no further rel
evance in relation to the remedy for breach of that confidentiality.

It is, in principle, undesirable and, in practice, difficult to make an unambiguous finding, at an interlocutory stage in civil proceedings, as to whether or not a cri
me was committed. In addition, even if it was established that a crime has been committed, it by no means necessarily gives rise to a civil cause of action. Accordingly, at this stage, while we properly can, and do, conclude that there is a real possibili
ty that an offence under the 1990 Act was committed when Robert Tchenguiz obtained copies of Mr Imerman\rquote 
s documents downloaded from the server in early 2009, it is not possible and not necessary to reach a final conclusion on that issue.  It is not necessary because for the purposes of considering the impact of Mrs. Imerman\rquote s and her brothers\rquote 
submissions it is only necessary to bear in mind that, if she is correct, she can obtain the advantage of the retention of copies of the seven files notwithstanding their criminal activities.

We turn to the somewhat more complex 1998 Act. The alleged breach of statutory duty arises out of section 4(4), which imposes a duty on a \'93data controller\'94 to comply with \'93the data protection principles\'94, set out in schedule 1, in relation to 
\'93all personal data [of] which he is data controller\'94. Section 1 of the 1998 Act contains definitions; \'93data controller\'94 is defined as meaning  \'93a person who ... determines the purposes for whi
ch and the manner in which any personal data are ... processed\'94; \'93personal data\'94 is defined as meaning \'93data which relate to a living individual who can be identified ... from those data ...\'94.

strongly arguable that Robert, and possibly Vincent, Tchenguiz appear to have been, data controllers, given their ownership of, and ability to access and control, the server and the IT systems in the Office. It seems, at least on the face of it, highly pr
obable that some of the material copied from Mr Imerman\rquote s documents accessed from the server included \'93personal data\'94, although there is authority which supports the notion that that expression should be given a narrow meaning.

shall be processed fairly and lawfully\'94, and only if \'93one of the conditions in schedule 2 is met\'94. There is force in the argument that, far from being lawful, fair and in accordance with schedule 2, the accessing i
n early 2009 failed all three requirements. It was arguably not lawful because of the alleged breach of the 1990 Act; it was arguably not fair because of the secret and indiscriminate way the access was effected; it was arguably not in accordance with sch
edule 2, because, contrary to the defendants\rquote  arguments, it was not \'93necessary ... for the administration of justice\'94 or \'93necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller\'94
, the two primary grounds floated by the defendants (and found respectively in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Schedule 2).

The issue of necessity lies at the heart of the argument that there is or should be a special dispensation in the Family Division which permits Mrs Imerman to retain copies of documen
ts, prior to the time at which the rules dictate she was entitled to them and without court order. We have resolved that more general but crucial issue against Mrs Imerman (see below). Accordingly, and quite apart from anything else, in so far as it is sa
id to have been \'93necessary\'94 to protect Mrs Imerman\rquote 
s interests, there is compelling attraction in the argument that it was not necessary, because Mrs Imerman could have applied to the court for a search and seize order or a preservation order rather than he
r brother, or brothers, taking the law into his, or their, own hands.

The defendants largely took their stand on the argument that the material accessed did not include personal data, given the narrow meaning of that expression, although they did not conce
de any other points. On the basis of the arguments we have heard, it is clear that Mr Imerman has a powerful case to the effect that, in accessing and copying his computer records, Robert Tchenguiz was in breach of his statutory duty under section 4(4) of
 the 1998 Act, and that Vincent Tchenguiz may also have been liable.

But there is no need to resolve the issue. Resolution of the issues of confidentiality and its breach in the context of ancillary relief proceedings make it unnecessary to resolve the spec
ific question of breach of statutory duty. It is, however, relevant to observe, just as in relation to alleged criminality, that the question whether there is a basis for condoning unlawful activity in ancillary relief proceedings must embrace the real po
ssibility of condoning a breach of statutory duty.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681\charrsid12520908

 retain those copies. That, after all was the ruling of Moylan J, even though he regarded Mrs Imerman\rquote s behaviour as being at the extreme end of the range of behaviour he had seen in 30 years.

It is frequent in matri
monial disputes for one party (in this case the wife) to suspect that the other party is about to destroy documents, or conceal information which is, or may be, relevant to the proceedings, and to do so with a view to preventing her from obtaining from th
e
 court the financial provision to which she claims to be entitled. While the law provides for court orders to be made for the preservation and obtaining of evidence for the purpose of future legal proceedings, claimants, or potential claimants, sometimes 
r
esort to measures of self-help, by copying, seizing, or attempting to access digital copies of documents. The other party in such a case, in this case the husband, has rights, including privacy, confidentiality and legal professional privilege, in relatio
n
 to relevant documents. The rights of privacy and confidentiality (but not any right of privilege) may be overridden by the competing public interest that any trial should be conducted on full evidence where the documents are relevant. But unless a docume
n
t or information is relevant to the actual or intended proceedings in question, the rights of privacy and confidentiality will not be overridden at the instance of the potential or actual claimant, here the wife. These measures of self-help therefore give
 rise to legal difficulties.

The difficulties that measures of self help give rise to in this context include the danger that the husband's rights will be overridden, when they would not be overridden if the matter had been the subject of an applicati
on for a preservation or search order made to the court. Rights of confidentiality, and legal professional privilege, have long been protected by the common law. Measures of self-help could in the past involve the commission of civil wrongs, such as tresp
a
ss, breach of confidence and breach of copyright. In the last 20 years or so the legal protection of information has been greatly increased. This has in large measure been in response to the development of computers and their use for word processing and s
e
nding of electronic messages. The amount of information that can be stored on a laptop is vast, and techniques for copying are quick and simple for experts. So the potential fruits of self-help are of a different order from those of former days. These dev

, or, indeed, we would add, on any other basis. The tort of trespass to chattels has been known to our law since the Middle Ages and the law of confidence for at least 200 years, yet no hint of any defences of the kind now being suggested is to be found a
n
ywhere in the books. Self-help has a narrow and jealously policed role to play, for example, in the form of the right in certain circumstances to abate a nuisance, but it is far too late to suggest that self-help should be extended into the territory we a
re here concerned with. After all, legislative prohibition of self-help, enforced with criminal penalties, dates back to the Statute of Marlborough of 1267. Section 1, which is still on the statute book, after providing that \'93
all persons, as well of high as of low estate, shall receive justice in the King\rquote s court\'94, prohibits anyone taking \'93revenge or distress of his own authority, without award of the King\rquote s court\'94
 and provides for the punishment of offenders by fine. We do not suggest that this provision is directly applicable in a case such as this; rather we point to it as illustrative of the law\rquote s long-standing aversion to unregulated self-help.    }{

Nor, in our judgment, and with great respect to Wilson LJ, do we think that section 25 will bear the weight of the argument sought to be founded on it. It is true that section 25(2)(a) provides that, when making financial provision, the court must \'93
have regard to ... the [actual and prospective] income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources [available to] each of the parties\'94
. However, that cannot automatically require the court to admit any evidence and every document which relates to such issues irrespective of the circumstances in which the
y were obtained. In the first place, the reference in the section must be to the financial circumstances as assessed by the court on the basis of the evidence which it has received and weighed, so if certain evidence has been excluded, it is not relevant 
to the exercise the court has to carry out. Secondly, section 25(2)(g) also requires the court to \'93have regard to ... the conduct of each of the parties ... if that conduct is such that it would be inequitable to disregard it\'94

 would be more reluctant to grant such orders in the family context, bearing in mind the more emotionally charged nature of the relationship between the parties than in the commercial context. We are unconvinced by that argument, given that the alternativ

 of the principles has to be made to the facts and features of the particular case before the court.

\insrsid10386681 case for a search and seize order, it would be refused. We do not agree with this analysis of that decision. The reason that peremptory relief was refused in that case was (page 146e-g) that it was \'93not necessary\'94
 for the documents in question to be seized, as there was another way of getting them. It is fair to say that the judgment of Ward LJ in that passage, with its reference to the \'93Draconian innovation\'94
 nature of the order sought, may have operated to discourage such applications. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 133.\tab}It is also true that, in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 Burgess v Burgess }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 [1996] 2 FLR 34, Waite LJ suggested that a search and seize order was \'93a rare weapon for use only in extreme or exceptional cases\'94
. If (as we believe) Waite LJ thereby meant that such an order would rarely be sought in ancillary relief proceedings and should only be sought when it was proportionate, just as in proceedings in the Queen\rquote 
s Bench and Chancery Divisions, then we would agree. However, if (which we doubt) he meant that such orders should be more difficult to obtain in ancillary relief proceedings than in ordinary civil proceedings, we would disagree.

In our view, at least in general, such applications should be seriously considered where there are substantial reasons for believing that a husband is concealing or dissipating assets, or 
intending to conceal or destroy documents. In such a case, subject of course to any other factors which are relevant, such as whether an order, and if so what order, is proportionate, a peremptory order to protect the wife\rquote 
s rights would often be justified.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 135.\tab}
Of course, such orders, particularly search and seize orders, can be expensive to obtain and execute, and we accept that, particularly in cases where the amount at stake is not substantial, the cost-effectiveness, or proportionality, of seeking such an o
rder may be questionable. But in many cases where a wife has reason to be concerned that her husband may be in the process of concealing assets or documents, or the like, seeking }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 ex parte}{\rtlch\fcs1

 course almost routinely taken when a claimant, in a case involving commercial breach of confidence, passing off or breach of intellectual property rights, believes that the defendant is concealing or destroying infringing items, incriminating material or
 relevant documents. We are confident that the judges of the Family Division can be relied upon to exercise these powers appropriately, indeed robustly.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 136.\tab}
Had that course been taken in this case, there would have been no question of any breach of confidence, tort, or statutory crime having been committed through accessing and copying Mr Imerman\rquote 
s electronic documents. So, too, there would have been no question of his rights of confidence being invaded by the defendants, the forensic accountants, the barrister 
who checked the seven files for privilege, Mrs Imerman or Withers, who were provided with information confidential to Mr  Imerman, and extracted from those documents. The determination of whether any of Mr Imerman\rquote 
s documents, and if so what documents, wer
e to be seized, inspected, checked, preserved, sent to Withers, or used by Mrs Imerman, or were to be subject to some other order, would have been determined, supervised, regulated and approved by the court, and any such exercise, having been approved by 
the court, would be lawful, both in domestic law, and in the eyes of the Strasbourg Court: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 Chappell v United Kingdom }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681

rules seek to prevent. But there is no basis for any special rules. Many litigants in all jurisdictions are driven by their greed or other unworthy motives to lie and cheat. The rules, and the judges\rquote  applica

 countenance recourse to self-help in circumstances where the court itself declines to act, and when to do so would be not merely unprincipled but an unjustifiable invasion of someone\rquote 
s rights? In the instant appeal Mrs Imerman was not entitled to the confidential information at the stage she obtained it. The Family Proceedings Rules prevented it. The law forbids it. She should not be allowed to 
obtain an advantage over her husband who, for all the court knows, would have been honest when the time came for him to be honest, namely at the time the Rules required him to disclose his assets through Form E.

It seems to me that if investigative agents employed by solicitors for the purpose of litigation were permitted to breach the provisions of such statutes or to indulge in fraud or impersonation without any consequence at all
 for the conduct of the litigation, then the courts would be going far to sanction such conduct. Of course, there is always the sanction of prosecutions or civil suits, and those must always remain the primary sanction for any breach of the criminal or ci
v
il law. But it seems to me that criminal or fraudulent conduct for the purposes of acquiring evidence in or for litigation cannot properly escape the consequence that any documents generated by or reporting on such conduct and which are relevant to the is
s
ues in the case are discoverable and fall outside the legitimate area of legal professional privilege. It is not as though there are not legitimate avenues which can be sought with the aid of the court to investigate (for instance) banking documents. That
 apparently is true in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname country-region}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}Switzerland{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} as well. In any event, the material being investigated is usually material whi}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0

uch circumstances, it does not seem to me to be too great an intrusion on legal professional privilege to require that documentation such as is in question in this case should be disclosed. Otherwise the position would be that the party employing the crim
i
nal or fraudulent agent would have it entirely within his own power to decide which of the criminally or fraudulently acquired information he was willing to rely on and disclose and which he was not. Where such a party will be asking the court to make inf

As we have sought to emphasise, at the time the information was taken unlawfully, Mr Imerman was under no obligation whatever to disclose his assets, still less to disclose private documents relating to those assets.  The rules required him only to give f

ll disclosure under Form E.  Only thereafter might he be ordered to disclose further documents should the court think it necessary. Accordingly, since the rules specifically exclude any such obligation, it is not possible, it is simply unacceptable, to co
untenance Mrs Imerman taking the law into her own hands so as to obtain a premature advantage.

In the present case, there is no real doubt but that the defendants have substantially breached Mr Imerman\rquote s right
s of confidence in relation to much, and probably the great majority, of the information obtained through accessing it through the server on some nine occasions in early 2009. Furthermore, there seems to be a substantial possibility that the information w
a
s all obtained as a result of some of the defendants committing a breach of statutory duty or even a crime. In the absence of good reason to the contrary, Mr Imerman could reasonably expect the court to order that all the documents so accessed, and any co
p
ies thereof, whether in electronic or paper form, be delivered up to him or destroyed, and that the defendants be enjoined from using any information obtained from those documents. Again, in the absence of good reason to the contrary, and as Mrs Imerman d
i
d not receive the seven files as a bona fide purchaser without notice, Mr Imerman could reasonably expect similar orders against her (and her servants and agents, to use the traditional language, thereby including Withers) in respect of the documents and 
information in the seven files.

outside the family home, at his place of business, and it involved a vast number of documents (the majority of which will have had no bearing on the ancillary relief proceedings, let alone the Leconfield House issue), which were then electronically copied
, and, in many cases, copied onto paper. Moylan J described the case as being \'93at the extreme end of the range of behaviour which I have seen during the course of the last 30 years\'94

We emphasise that, at this stage, it is not possible to say that Mr Imerman has failed in his Form E to reveal all his assets, or that he has sought to divest himself of any assets for the purpose of his ancillary relief l

Mrs Imerman should not be entitled to benefit in any way from the wholesale, wrongful, and possibly criminal, accessing and copying of Mr Imerman\rquote s confidential documents, particularly as she could hav
e been expected to apply for a peremptory order (given that the expense of applying for and enforcing such an order would appear to be proportionate in this case, at least on the information we have seen). It would be unrealistic to make too much of this 
l
atter point in this case, as the notion that a wife should seek peremptory relief in this sort of case appears, for some reason, to have been thought to be inappropriate as a matter of general practice. Having said that, we should emphasise that, in futur

We cannot agree with Moylan J that Mrs Imerman, or her solicitors, should be entitled to retain any copies of any part of the seven files. It would give her access to materia
l which was confidential to Mr Imerman, and had been unlawfully taken from him by her brother and supplied to her, in circumstances where it is not the court or Mr Imerman, but her brothers, who selected the documents, where there was no compelling eviden
ce that he was avoiding his responsibilities to her, and where she will be protected by an order which ensures that all the documents will be preserved and will remain in the possession of Mr Imerman\rquote

The order we propose seeks to achieve a fair balance, or at least as fair a balance as can be achieved in t
he circumstances, between two competing concerns. On the one hand, there is obvious justice in seeking to eliminate, or at least to minimise, the benefit to Mrs Imerman, and the disadvantage to Mr Imerman, of her being able to use his confidential documen
t
s, which she should not have seen, and which were accessed and copied unlawfully. On the other hand, there is also obvious justice in seeking to ensure that Mr Imerman cannot dispose of or hide documents which he is or may become obliged to produce to the
 court or to Mrs Imerman under the Rules or pursuant to a court order, and that he will at least find it more difficult to hide his assets (if that is what he has done or intends to do).

 order restraining Mrs Imerman, at least for the time being, whether by herself or through Withers, from using any of the information they have obtained through reading the seven files. Again, events may develop in such a way that it becomes appropriate f
or that order to be modified or even discharged. However, at the moment, given that the seven files will be in the custody of}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \expnd0\expndtw-3\insrsid10386681\charrsid8260897  Hughes Fowler Carruthers}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 , who, as Mr Imerman\rquote s solicitors in the ancillary relief proceedings, have duties to the court as well as

The only real argument raised against this order on behalf of Mrs Imerman is that she may know more about some aspects of Mr Imerman\rquote s affairs than }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \expnd0\expndtw-3\insrsid10386681\charrsid8260897

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 , but which would put her on notice of other assets. It would be wrong to reject that argument as 
having no conceivable force, but it strikes us as very weak. No specific examples or grounds were given to support such a possibility in this case, and it seems to us that it is far too weak and speculative to justify departing from the order we would oth
erwise think it right to make.

As for the very substantial body of material which was obtained by, and is held by, or to the order of, any of the defendants in the Queen\rquote s Bench proceedings, we think it right to make similar orders, both in relation to the
 documents (and any copies) and in relation to the use of any information obtained therefrom. There is a much stronger case for saying that this material should simply be handed over to Mr Imerman, as the documents which were thought to be relevant in the
 
ancillary relief proceedings, namely the seven files, were provided to Withers, and there is no other conceivable basis for any of the rest of the material not being simply returned to Mr Imerman. However, one of our concerns about the seven files is that
 
the contents were selected, at least in part, by the Tchenguiz brothers, who are not lawyers or accountants, and they may therefore have included documents which had no bearing on the ancillary relief proceedings; by the same token, there is a real risk (
a
lbeit, we acknowledge, a lesser one) that the material retained by the defendants, and not passed on to Withers, include documents relevant to those proceedings. We therefore consider that, in order to protect Mrs Imerman (but not, we emphasise, the defen
d
ants), similar orders are appropriate in relation to the documents held by, or to the order of, any of the defendants, as we are disposed to make in relation to the seven files. However, we would, at least as at present minded and in principle, be sympath
e
tic to an application by Mr Imerman, supported by appropriate evidence, that all the documents other than the seven files be handed back to him; indeed, we would expect Mrs Imerman to take a realistic attitude to any such proposal, thereby hopefully avoid
ing the need to involve the court.

 respective rights to an appropriately intense focus, and have made an appropriate assessment of any justification for enc

We agree with Eady J that, subject to one set, the defendants should return all copies of the material extracted from Mr Imerman\rquote s documents stored on the server (or any copies thereof),
 and that they should be enjoined from communicating any of the information they have gleaned therefrom. However, as is provided in the order drawn up following Eady J\rquote

 rather than with Mr Imerman, in case it includes documents which are disclosable in the ancillary relief proceedings. There is no reason why the order should not be a final order, provided that both Mr
s Imerman and Mr Imerman have permission to apply. Mrs Imerman (or the Tchenguiz brothers on her behalf) should have such permission in case she wishes to vary the injunction to enable the Tchenguiz brothers to communicate to her some of the information t

different view from Moylan J in the Family Division proceedings. We understand why he thought it was fair that, once Mr Imerman had had the opportunity to remove any privileged documents, the seven files should be available to Mrs Imerman. However, in thi

s documents stored on the server, and then making and disseminating copies. However, it is clear that Nouri Obayda and Vincent Tchengui
z also played a part. All the defendants resisted the application for an injunction and for delivery up. In the light of this, we see nothing wrong in Eady J concluding that, if such orders were justified against Robert Tchenguiz, the first to fourth defe
n
dants should all be required (i) to hand back any copies in their possession of the documents which had been copied, and (ii) not to disseminate any information they had gathered from the documents. If they had no such documents or information, then the o
rder would not affect them, but, as there was a risk that they might, the Judge was entitled to take the view that Mr Imerman should be granted protective relief against them \endash 
 not least as they gave him no assurance to that effect when he sought it.

 Mr Zaiwalla, it must depend on the precise facts of a particular case whether a solicitor, who has been provided by his client with documents which are confidential to a claimant, is a proper defendant, in addition to his client, in confidence proceeding
s
 brought by the claimant. A solicitor who receives, reads, and passes on such documents, particularly knowing that they have been taken from the claimant unlawfully, may well be an appropriate defendant. Without intending thereby to suggest that Mr Zaiwal
l
a necessarily read all or any of the documents, or acted wrongly in any way, we consider that, on the unusual facts of this case, it was proper exercise of professional judgment for counsel to have joined Mr Zaiwalla in the proceedings, and a proper exerc
ise of Eady J\rquote s case management powers, with which this court should not interfere, to have made an order which extended to him.

s telephone conversation with Vincent Tchenguiz. It was argued that, in the light of what Mr Imerman said in that conversation, his pursuit of the appeal against the Family Division order, and his claim against Mr Zaiwalla in the Queen\rquote

nd at times tasteless, even offensive, contents of the telephone conversation are said to show that Mr Imerman does not really care whether the seven files are retained by Mrs Imerman, or that he would be prepared to let her keep the files if other docume
n
ts in her possession were provided to him. We accept that, if one takes the odd statement, in the course of a longish telephone conversation, out of context, it could be said to show that Mr Imerman appeared to be fairly relaxed about the fact that his wi
f
e had received the seven files, but that is of no relevance: he could have been putting a brave face on things, bluffing, or seeking to improve his negotiating position, to identify only some possibilities. One thing he was not doing was giving up his rig
h
t to pursue these applications or appeals. Similarly irrelevant is the fact that he might have been prepared to trade any right he had to object to Mrs Imerman using the seven files in return for his being given certain documents and information: the fact
 that he might have been prepared to settle his claim does not mean that he should not be allowed to pursue it.

The offensive remarks in the telephone conversation related to Mr Zaiwalla, and do not need to be repeated in this judgment. While distasteful a

 it, is an entirely separate matter from those raised by these appeals. It involves an allegation by Robert Tchenguiz that, fraudulently and in breach of fiduciary duty, Mr Imerman arranged for a company called Whyte & Mckay to pay substantial sums, for 
\'93services and office accommodation\'94
 which it enjoyed and occupied to a company which he wholly owned. This is said to have been dishonest because the accommodation in question was in the Office, which had been provided to Mr Imerman by Robert Tchenguiz for n
othing, and Robert Tchenguiz was kept in ignorance of the charge made to Whyte & Mckay.

This so-called Leconfield House issue is now only live in relation to costs, and it is therefore inappropriate to deal with it at this stage, although we were, somewhat unenthusiastically, invited to do so. It was faintly suggested that Mr Imerman\rquote 
s alleged wrong-doing in charging Whyte & Mckay somehow provided additional justification for accessing his documents on the server. There is nothing in that argument. Concer
n that he had acted wrongly in charging a company for space which he was permitted by Robert Tchenguiz to occupy for nothing, without telling Robert Tchenguiz, cannot begin to justify accessing Mr Imerman\rquote 
s computer records. In any event, the evidence suggests that it was, at best, an ancillary reason for accessing Mr Imerman\rquote 
s records. The basic evidence on the Leconfield House issue was already available to Robert Tchenguiz, and if (which appears very unlikely indeed) that evidence justified a peremptory search of Mr Imerman\rquote 
s records, an application for a search order could have been made.

In our view, the only relevance of the Leconfield House issue for present purposes is that it provides another reason why, rightly or wrongly, the Tchenguiz family had, by February 2009, formed a very jaundiced opinion of Mr Imerman\rquote 
s honesty. In so far as it may be necessary to consider this issue further for the purpose of an order for costs, it can be dealt with by written submissions following receipt of this judgment, in the normal way.

s order. For the reasons already given, we have concluded that the seven files, and any copies of any of their contents, should be handed over to Mr Imerman\rquote 
s solicitors and not returned to Mrs Imerman or her solicitors (at least until any subsequent order). Accordingly, the cross-appeal effectively falls away. However, it is right to record that we would have been unsympathetic to the notion that 
anyone other than Mr Imerman and his solicitors (and, if they thought it appropriate, his counsel) should be involved in looking at the seven files and considering which of the documents were properly the subject of legal professional privilege or litigat
ion privilege.

We have left until this stage consideration of the future use in the ancillary relief proceeding
s of the information and documents obtained by Mrs Imerman. We distinguish between the documents (which, because of the order we have made, she will no longer have access to unless at some stage her husband produces them, either voluntarily or pursuant to
 an order made in the ancillary relief proceedings) and any relevant information she may have, including but not limited to whatever she may be able to recall of the contents of the documents. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 169.\tab}At this stage there is no question of any use at all. It is pre
mature to consider utilisation of the information which Mrs Imerman obtained until the time for which the Rules provide. That is after her husband\rquote 
s Form E has been delivered and if and when she is inviting the court to conclude that his disclosure has bee
n inadequate or dishonest. At that stage Mrs Imerman might be in a position to challenge the adequacy of his disclosure on the basis of the information she had previously seen in documents she has been compelled to return. Of course, compelled as she shou
l
d be to return copies, her recollection will be inadequate. But if there is information, which will include the records of conversations with her brothers, to suggest inadequate disclosure by her husband, that is the time she can deploy it. There is, as M
o
styn J pointed out (in the passage we have cited at [113]), no process by which her recollection of what she has learnt from the documents can be removed. And it is unlikely that the husband will be able to resist reliance by the wife on such evidence mer
ely by saying that part of the information she relies upon had been culled from documents unlawfully obtained.

After all, the use in court as evidence of material which has been improperly obtained (whether in breach of confidence, tortiously, or even crimi
nally) is permissible, though such use may be refused by the court or permitted only on terms. Subject to certain exceptions, notably information obtained by torture, the common law does not normally concern itself with the way evidence was obtained when 
considering admissibility: see }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 R v Sang }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 [1980] AC 402, relying on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 Kuruma v The Queen }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 [1955] AC 197. Accordingly, in the present case, it appears to us that information derived from the documents obtained, albeit unlawfully, from Mr Imerman\rquote s computer record
s is, subject to questions of privilege and relevance, admissible in the ancillary relief proceedings. However, just because it is admissible, it does not follow that the court is obliged to admit it.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 171.\tab}Thus, it appears that, as a matter of common law, a jud
ge often has the power to exclude admissible evidence if satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 Marcel v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid10386681 [1992] Ch 225, page 265, per Sir Christopher Slade. Where the CPR apply, the position is even clearer: see }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 Jones v {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname PlaceType}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}University{\*\xmlclose} of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname PlaceName}}Warwick{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 [2003] EWCA Civ 151,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\insrsid10386681  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 [2003] 1 WLR 954. In that case, relying on CPR 32.1(2), which provides in terms that the court can exclude evidence, as well as the overriding objective in CPR 1.1, the Court of Appeal he
ld that the trial judge had a discretion as to whether or not to admit highly relevant evidence obtained in an underhand manner. Although they upheld his decision to admit the evidence, it is quite clear from the reasoning that the court had power to excl
ude it in the light of the way in which it had been obtained.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 172.\tab}
It was suggested by Mr Turner for Mrs Imerman that a judge in ancillary relief proceedings has no such power. We do not agree. First, the equivalent of the overriding objective in CPR 1.1 applies
 to ancillary relief proceedings: see Rule 2.51D of the Family Proceedings Rules. Secondly, and even more significantly, unlike in proceedings governed by the CPR, where the parties have a general disclosure obligation, and can normally choose what docume
ntary evidence to tender, it is, as we have said, the court which controls what documents are to be disclosed and tendered by way of evidence in ancillary relief proceedings. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 173.\tab}As these provisions indicate, judges hearing ancillary relief applications, unlik
e judges in normal civil proceedings, have a far greater control than they have under the CPR in normal civil proceedings, over which documents should or should not be produced in evidence. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 174.\tab}It seems to us that, where the court is satisfied that a husband 
has documents which may be relevant to the issue before it, but that his wife has, in some way retained copies of those documents she has wrongly obtained, it would be open to the court in an appropriate case to refuse to order the husband to produce the 
d
ocuments on the ground that to do otherwise would render the way it dealt with the application unfair, even taking into account the fact that the documents contain, or may contain, information which is relevant to the proceedings. Equally, it would be ope
n
 to the court in an appropriate case to permit the wife to give evidence of their contents as a prelude to ordering the husband to produce them,   However,  on our analysis of the law,  it is unlikely that questions as to use of unlawfully obtained docume
n
ts will arise in the future.  Hitherto the family courts have, as we have pointed out at [108], considered the question of the use of unlawfully obtained documents at a time when no prior application has been made for their delivery up, along with any cop
ies.  Now, if we are right, by the time the court comes to consider the adequacy of the husband\rquote s disclosure any wrongfully obtained documents will have been returned.  The question for the court will be, in the future, the extent to which the wife
\rquote s recollection of information derived from unlawfully obtained documents may be deployed to establish the inadequacy of her husband\rquote s disclosure. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 175.\tab}
It was also suggested that the court would have no power to exclude documents which might affect the ancillary relief
 awarded, in the light of the provisions of section 25 of the 1973 Act. It is true that section 25(2)(a) provides that, when making financial provision, the court must \'93
have regard to ... the [actual and prospective] income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources [available to] each of the parties\'94
. However, and as we have already explained, that cannot automatically require the court to admit any evidence and every document which relates to such issues, however unfair the court thinks that it would be to do so. 
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 176.\tab}
It would be surprising if the court in ancillary relief proceedings had no power to exclude evidence which was confidential to the husband and had been wrongly obtained from his records, however outrageous the circumstances of the 
obtaining of the evidence and however unfair on the husband it would be to admit the evidence. It would be all the more surprising in the light of the Human Rights Act 1998. As was explained by Ward LJ in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid10386681 
Lifely v Lifely }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid10386681 [2008] EWCA Civ 904, in a case of this type, the decision whether to admit or exclude evidence involves weighing one party\rquote s (in this case, the wife\rquote 
s) article 6 right to a fair trial with all the available evidence, against the other party\rquote s (the husband\rquote s) article 8 right to respect for privacy. (It may also involve the wife\rquote 
s right under Article 10 to say what she wants to say, and the husband\rquote s article 6 right, on the basis that he might say the trial was unfair if it extended to evidence which had been wrongly, even illegally, obtained from him).
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\ltrpar \s22 \rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs20 \ltrch\fcs0 \lang2057\langfe1033\langfenp1033\insrsid10386681 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 177.\tab}
Accordingly, we consider that, in ancillary relief proceedings, while the court can admit such evidence, it has power to exclude it if unlawfully obtained, including power to exclude documents whose existence has only been established by unlawfu
l means. In exercising that power, the court will be guided by what is \'93necessary for disposing fairly of the application for ancillary relief or for saving costs\'94, and will take into account the importance of the evidence, \'93
the conduct of the parties\'94, an
d any other relevant factors, including the normal case management aspects. Ultimately, this requires the court to carry out a balancing exercise, something which, we are well aware, is easy to say in general terms but is often very difficult to effect in
 individual cases in practice.
