\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {This appeal raises the important question of whether the Human Rights Act 1998 (\'93the Human Rights Act\'94) has impacted o
n the protection afforded to owners of copyright by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (\'93the Copyright Act\'94).  The appellants (\'93Telegraph Group\'94
) contend that it has. They contend that, when considering whether an actionable breach of copyright has occurred or {\*\bkmkstart Orderstart}{\*\bkmkend Orderstart}
the remedies appropriate in the event of such a breach, the Court must now have regard to the right of freedom of expression conferred by Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights (\'93the Convention\'94).  This, so 
Telegraph Group contend, requires the Court to give individual consideration to the facts of each case in order to assess the impact of Article 10.

ht Act to the relevant facts.  That, in this case, he has done and, in a judgment delivered on 11}{\super  }{January 2001 [2001] 2 WLR 967 has held that the Telegraph Group infringed the respondent\rquote

At the general election on 1 May 1997 the Labour party won 419 seats, the Conservatives 165, the Liberal Democrats 49 and other parties 29.  The scale of Labour's landslide was expected by many to put an end to any plans for formal co-operation betw
een Labour and the Liberal Democrats and for review of the voting system (with the possible introduction of some form of proportional representation).  In fact, however, high-level contacts continued.  This case is concerned with a confidential record of 
a particularly important meeting held at 10 Downing Street on the evening of 21 October 1997.  
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 4.\tab}The record was made by the leader of the Liberal Democrats, then invariably referred to as Mr Paddy Ashdown. He has since relinquished the leadership of the L
iberal Democrats and has been honoured, first with a knighthood and then with a life peerage.  But he is not so readily recognisable as Sir Jeremy Ashdown or Lord Ashdown and it is simpler (and involves no disrespect) to refer to him as he was known at th
e time of the events with which the Court is concerned.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 5.\tab}
Since he became leader of the Liberal Democrats in 1988 Mr Ashdown had kept detailed diaries and other records of his life and political career.  He treated these as confidential and kept them secur
e.  If he showed them to others it was on a confidential basis.  His record of the meeting on 21 October 1997 was prepared on that basis.  The meeting had been attended by only five persons: apart from Mr Ashdown they were the Prime Minister, Mr Peter Man
d
elson, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead and Mr Jonathan Powell.  Mr Ashdown dictated his minute of the meeting later that evening and it was typed by his secretary at the House of Commons.  Only two copies were made.  One was placed with Mr Ashdown's diaries and 
associated records in a safe in his constituency, Yeovil.  The other was read by a few of his closest advisers and then was shredded.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 6.\tab}About two years later, when it was known that Mr Ashdown was standing down from the leadership of the Liberal Democrats,
 it also became known that he was thinking of publishing his diaries.  He had formed this idea in about February 1999 and spent some time on sorting and editing material.  His plans for publication were referred to in a radio interview called 'Resigning I
s
sues' which was broadcast on 16 November 1999.  Mr Ashdown referred to the possibility of publication in two stages because of the sensitivity of some of the material.  At about this time some of Mr Ashdown's material, including the minute of the meeting 
o
n 21 October 1997, was shown in strict confidence to eight individuals who were representatives of newspapers or publishing houses.  Considerable interest was shown but no contract was entered into before the publication by the Sunday Telegraph of which M
r Ashdown has complained.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 7.\tab}By some unknown means a copy of 
the minute reached the hands of the political editor of the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Joe Murphy.  Mr Murphy's evidence was that it came from an individual who did not work for Mr Ashdown, or for the Liberal Democrats, and who thought that "the record should b
e
 set straight".  The Sunday Telegraph did not pay for the minute.  Mr Murphy knew that the minute was authentic, and that it was confidential.  Indeed it is described as a "leaked document" and a "secret record" in the first and second sentences of his fr
ont-page article in the Sunday Telegraph on 28 November 1999.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 8.\tab}
The Sunday Telegraph of that date published three separate items on the minute.  There was the front-page article by Mr Murphy; a major story (headed exclusive and illustrated by sketches of t
he five participants) on pages 4 and 5; and a comment by Mr Matthew d'Ancona, a political columnist, on page 33.  Mr Ashdown's Counsel virtually conceded that the items on pages 1 and 33, had they stood alone, would not have been actionable as copyright i
nfringement.  The thrust of the attack based on infringement was directed to the main story on pages 4 and 5, which contained several verbatim quotations from the minute.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 9.\tab}The full text of the minute has not been disclosed in these proceedings.  The Court
 has a redacted copy disclosing only those passages which were either quoted verbatim or closely summarised.  But it is possible to see that the minute was a nine-page document and that Mr Murphy has made most use of the last four pages of it.  The Court 
w
as not given any precise statistics (sensibly, since infringement of copyright is not a matter of statistics) but it appears that very roughly one-quarter of the text of the main article on pages 4 and 5 consisted of verbatim or almost-verbatim reproducti
on of the minute, and very roughly one-fifth of the minute was reproduced in this way.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 10.\tab}
As to the factual content of the articles, there was some lively reporting of what had been said by the Prime Minister, Mr Ashdown and others.  An adequate picture of
 this can be derived from the Vice-Chancellor's summary of the political comments made by the Sunday Telegraph journalists ([2001] 2 WLR at p.976 C-E):
\par }\pard\plain \s24\qj \li1440\ri1440\sa240\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin1440\lin1440\itap0 \fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {"The points made by the writers are: (1) the minute confirmed that the Prime Minster had seriously inten
ded to form a coalition Cabinet by the inclusion of two Liberal Democrat members of Parliament in place of two Cabinet ministers who were Labour members of Parliament notwithstanding the large majority he enjoyed as the result of the election in May 1997;
 
(2) the disclosure contradicted the denials emanating from 10 Downing Street; (3) the co-operation between the Prime Minister and [Mr Ashdown] went beyond discussing a coalition Cabinet and extended to assisting the Liberal Democrats to win the by-electio
n
 then pending in Winchester and the Liberal Democrats toning down their criticism of the Government; ( 4) had the members of the Labour party known how far the Prime Minister had gone in the formation of a coalition Cabinet their opposition to voting refo

\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {On 6 December 1999 Mr Ashdown commenced proceedings against Telegraph Group, the proprietor of the Sunday Telegraph, making claims for breach of confidence and copyright infring
ement.  He was seeking injunctions and damages (or alternatively an account of profits).  On 30 June 2000, after a defence had been served, Mr Ashdown applied for summary judgment under Part 24 of the Civil Procedure Rules in respect of the copyright clai
m only.  This application was made on the basis that Telegraph Group had no real prospect of successfully defending the action, and that there was no other compelling reason for that part of the claim to go to trial (see CPR rule 24(2)).
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 12.\tab}After a two-day
 hearing in December 2000 the Vice-Chancellor on 11 January 2001 gave judgment against Telegraph Group on the copyright claim. He granted a final injunction against any further infringement and directed disclosure of information to enable Mr Ashdown to ex
ercise his right of election between damages and an account of profits.  However the Vice-Chancellor gave permission to appeal and his Order has been stayed pending the appeal.

\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {Before the Vice-Chancellor (as in this Court)
 it was common ground that the minute was a copyright work and that Mr Ashdown is the owner of the copyright.  It was also common ground that substantial parts of the minute had been copied in the Sunday Telegraph for 28 November 1999, especially in the m
a
in article.  Telegraph Group relied on the defence of fair dealing under s.30 of the Copyright Act; on the defence of public interest recognised or preserved by s.171(3) of the Copyright Act; and on provisions of the Human Rights Act including in particul
ar ss.3(1), 6(1) and 12(3) taken together with Article 10 of the Convention.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 14.\tab}
After stating the facts and the issues the Vice-Chancellor observed that there had been no previous reported case, either at Strasbourg or in the United Kingdom, as to the inte
raction of freedom of expression and copyright, or any other intellectual property right.  So he thought it best to consider the human rights aspect first.  
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 15.\tab}It had been argued on behalf of Telegraph Group that s.3(1) of the Human Rights Act required t
he Court, in interpreting and applying ss.30 and 171(3) of the Copyright Act, to do so in a way which preserved its right of freedom of expression under Article 10.  It was argued that the Court had to take account of all the individual facts to see wheth
er restriction of its freedom was necessary in a democratic society.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 16.\tab}
The Vice-Chance1lor accepted that Article 10 could be engaged (and is engaged in this case) in a claim for copyright infringement.  But he went on to hold ([2001] 2 WLR at p.972G):

 does not follow that because Article 10 is engaged the facts of each case have to be considered to determine whether the restriction imposed by the law of copyright goes further than what is necessary in a democratic society.  Article 10.2 recognises tha

\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {He rejected the submission that scrutiny of the facts of a particular case might show that the \lquote exceptions, exemptions and defences\rquote  provided for in intel

Copyright Act gives effect to the United Kingdom's obligations under the Berne Conventions of 1886 and 1971.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 18.\tab}After discussing a number of cases in the European Court of Human Rights (none of which was concerned with copyright) the Vice-Chancellor restat

 is the submission that the provisions of the 1988 Act are incapable by themselves and without more of satisfying requirement (3).  Indeed it was submitted in terms by counsel for the \'93Sunday Telegraph\'94
 that in every case the court should examine whether on the facts of that case it was necessary in democratic society to provide for exceptions, exemptions and def

ress exceptions to be found in the Act.  In these circumstances, we consider that the court is bound, insofar as it is able, to apply the Act in a manner that accommodates the right of freedom of expression.  This will make it necessary for the Court to l
ook closely at the facts of individual cases (as indeed it must whenever a \lquote fair dealing\rquote  defence is raised).  We do not foresee this leading to a flood of litigation.

y relief of an injunction.  Usually, so it seems to us, such a step will be likely to be sufficient.  If a newspaper considers it necessary to copy the exact words created by another, we can see no reason in principle why the newspaper should not indemnif
y the author for any loss caused to him, or alternatively account to him for any profit made as a result of copying his work.  Freedom of expression should not normally carry with it the right to make free use of another's work.

In the rare case where it is in the public interest that the words in respect of which another has copyright should be published without any sanction, we have been concerned to consider why this should not be permitted under the 'public interest' exceptio

 of copyright - the publication by The Sun of photographs of Princess Diana and Mr Dodi Fayed, with times recorded, taken by a security video camera owned by Mr Al Fayed.  The Sun claimed that it was in the public interest to publish these photographs as

I have pointed out earlier in this judgment that the basis of the defence of public interest in a breach of confidence action cannot be the same as the basis of such defence to an action for infringement of copyright.  In an action 
for breach of confidence the foundation of the action can fall away if that is required in the public interest, but that can never happen in a copyright action.  The jurisdiction to refuse to enforce copyright, which I believe has been recognised, comes f
rom the court\rquote s inherent jurisdiction.  It is limited to cases where enforcement of the copyright would offend against the policy of the law.  The }{\i Lion Laboratories}{
 case [1985] QB 526 was such a case.  Lion Laboratories sought to obtain an interlocutory inj
unction to restrain publication of documents which showed that they had suppressed information leading to or which might lead to the wrongful conviction of motorists.  The action was based upon documents which in the circumstances reeked of turpitude.  As
 Lord Mansfield CJ said in }{\i Holman v Johnson }{(1775) 1 Cowp 341, 343: \'93No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act.\'94
\par To rely upon copyright to suppress documents which could exonerate motorists convicted of drink driving or which might lead to their acquittal is, in my view, to found a case of action upon an immoral act.
\par The circumstances where it is against the policy of the law to use the court\rquote s procedure to enforce copyright are, I suspect, not capab
le of definition.  However it must be remembered that copyright is assignable and therefore the circumstances must derive from the work in question, not ownership of the copyright.  In my view a court would be entitled to refuse to enforce copyright if th
e work is: (i) immoral, scandalous or contrary to family life; (ii) injurious to public life, public health and safety or the administration of justice; (iii) incites or encourages others to act in a way referred to in (ii).\'94

In considering the circumstances in which copyright may be overridden in the public interest, Aldous LJ treats the }{\i Lion Laboratories}{
 case as an action based on documents which in the circumstances reeked of turpitude, and as one where the plaintiffs were, in substance, seeking to found upon an immoral act. That, however, does seem to me to be too restrictive a view of the }{\i 
Lion Laboratories}{ case on any view.  That case was decided on the basis that it is not necessary to find any immoral act or \lquote iniquity\rquote 
 on the part of a claimant in order to reach a conclusion that either breach of confidence or copyright is overridden. No distinction was drawn between the two in this connection, and Lord Denning MR\rquote s dictum in }{\i Fraser v Evans}{

Stuart Smith L.J. agreed that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Aldous L.J.  It does not seem to us that those reasons depended on the precise scope of the public interest exception identified by Aldous L.J.  The Court rejected a 'fair
 dealing' defence under s.30 in terms that left no scope for holding that it was in the public interest that the photographs should have been published, however wide the scope of that test.  Accordingly we have considered }{\i Lion Laboratories }{

\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 53.\tab}The facts of the case can be shortly summarised.  Lion Laboratories manufactured breathalyser kits widely used by the police for testing the breath 
of drivers suspected of being over the limit.  The first and second defendants worked for Lion Laboratories.  They removed without authority confidential memoranda which cast doubt on the accuracy of the breathalysers, and supplied these to a newspaper.  
L
ion Laboratories brought proceedings for both breach of confidentiality and breach of copyright.  They sought interlocutory injunctions.  The Court of Appeal held that there was a serious issue to be tried as to whether the defendants had a public interes

 it is in the public interest that they should be published now.  Equally there is no dispute that the copyright of these documents is in the plaintiffs and to publish them would infringe the plaintiffs\rquote

O'Connor L.J. approached the case on the basis that the gravamen of the plaintiffs' complaint was of breach of confidence and did not give separate consideration to breach of copyright.  Griffiths L.J., however, made the following observ
ations at the beginning of his judgment at p.550:
\par }\pard\plain \s24\qj \li1440\ri1440\sa240\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin1440\lin1440\itap0 \fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {\'93
The first question to be determined is whether there exists a defence of public interest to actions for breach of confidentiality and copyright, and if so, whether it is limited to situations in which ther
e has been serious wrongdoing by the plaintiffs-the so-called \'93iniquity\'94 rule.
\par I am quite satisfied that the defence of public interest is now well established in actions for breach of confidence and, although there is less authority on the point, that it also extends to breach of copyright: see by way of example }{\i Fraser v Evans
}{ [1969] 1 Q.B. 349; }{\i Hubbard v Vosper}{ [1972] 2 Q.B. 84: }{\i Woodward v Hutchins}{ [1977] W.L.R. 760 and }{\i British Steel Corporation v Granada Television Ltd}{ [1981] A.C. 1096.
\par I can see no sens
ible reason why this defence should be limited to cases in which there has been wrongdoing on the part of the plaintiffs.  I believe that the so-called iniquity rule evolved because in most cases where the facts justified a publication in breach of confid
e
nce, it was because the plaintiff had behaved so disgracefully or criminally that it was judged in the public interest that his behaviour should be exposed.  No doubt it is in such circumstances that the defence will usually arise, but it is not difficult
 to think of instances where, although there has been no wrongdoing on the part of the plaintiff, it may be vital in the public interest to publish a part of his confidential information.\'94

not current solely in the sense of recent in time, it was arguably a matter of current interest to the public.  In a democratic society, information about a meeting between the Prime Minister and an opposition party leader during the then current Parliame

.30 will normally afford the Court all the scope that it needs properly to reflect the public interest in freedom of expression and, in particular, the freedom of the press.  There will then be no need to give separate consideration to the availability of
 a public interest defence under s.171.

We have considered why it should ever be contrary to the public interest that a newspaper should have to pay compensation, or account for the profit made, when it makes unauthorised use of the work product of anot
her.  We have concluded that s.30 provides examples of situations where this may be justified, and that these are broadly in line with the Strasbourg jurisprudence in another area where freedom of expression has to be balanced against a justification for 
restricting that freedom which is recognised by Article 10.

In the field of defamation, the European Court of Human Rights has recognised that the awarding of damages by a public authority for press publication of defamatory statements may infringe Art
icle 10, at least where the publication consists of balanced reporting on a matter of current public interest.  The reason is that such liability may discourage the participation by the press in matters of public concern - }{\i 
Bladet Tromso and Stensaas v Norway }{(1999) 29 EHRR 125.  In }{\i Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. United Kingdom }{
(1995) 20 EHRR 442, where individual but not press freedom of expression was in issue, the Court held that Article 10 was infringed, not because damages were awarded, but because the size of 
the damages was disproportionate to the legitimate aim of providing reasonable compensation for injury to reputation.
\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s1 \lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 69.\tab}The fair dealing defence under s.30 should lie where the public interest in learning of the very words written by the owner of the cop
yright is such that publication should not be inhibited by the chilling factor of having to pay damages or account for profits.  When considering this question it is right to observe that, as damages are compensatory and not at large, they may produce a r
elatively mild chill.

It is impossible to lay down any hard-and-fast definition of what is fair dealing, for it is a matter of fact, degree and impression.  However, by far the most important factor is whether the alleged fair dealing is i
n fact commercially competing with the proprietor\rquote 
s exploitation of the copyright work, a substitute for the probable purchase of authorised copies, and the like.  If it is, the fair dealing defence will almost certainly fail.  If it is not and there is a 
moderate taking and there are no special adverse factors, the defence is likely to succeed, especially if the defendant\rquote 
s additional purpose is to right a wrong, to ventilate an honest grievance, to engage in political controversy, and so on.  The second m
ost important factor is whether the work has already been published or otherwise exposed to the public.  If it has not, and especially if the material has been obtained by a breach of confidence or other mean or underhand dealing, the courts will be reluc
t
ant to say this is fair.  However this is by no means conclusive, for sometimes it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate public controversy to make use of 'leaked' information.  The third most important factor is the amount and importance of the wor
k
 that has been taken.  For, although it is permissible to take a substantial part of the work (if not, there could be no question of infringement in the first place), in some circumstances the taking of an excessive amount, or the taking of even a small a
mount if on a regular basis, would negative fair dealing.\'94

In the same passage of their defence the Telegraph Group asserted that Mr Ashdown had already revealed some details of the matters covered in the articles in his radio interview about 'Resigning Issues'.

The Claimant had taken great care to limit the number of people who read it and to impose on them obligations of secrecy.  Moreover the Sunday Telegraph knew not only t
hat the Minute had not been published, indeed Mr Murphy described it as secret, but that, as the Claimant revealed on the Resigning Issues interview, he was thinking of doing so in the not to distant future.  It is not the case that during the interview f
or Resigning Issues the Claimant had already disclosed the important matters covered in the articles.\'94

 of copyright is publication of the form of the literary work, not the information that it contains.  It is beyond any doubt that the copyright work had never been published or otherwise exposed to the public before the publication in the Sunday Telegraph

At the same time, the fact that the minute was undoubtedly obtained in breach of confidence is a material consideration when considering the defence of fair dealing.  The Vice-Chancellor rightly attached importance to the fact that the minute was secr
