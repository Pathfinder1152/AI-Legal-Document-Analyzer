The factual background to this request for extradition, as alleged by the Respondent, is as follows.\~ In early 1997, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\'93ICE\'94
) agents in Tampa, Florida received information that Blue Sky Technologies (\'93BST\'94), a Tampa based company, was selling unauthorised Direct TV satellite television access cards without permission from Direct TV.\~
 It is alleged that BST manipulated the Di
rect TV access cards to receive all channels from Direct TV without payment and that BST also pirated programmers used to reprogramme Direct TV satellite television access cards to give the card user free access to all channels offered by Direct TV.

he information provided to ICE linked BST to a number of websites controlled by the Appellant.\~ The pirated access cards and programmers originated from the United Kingdom.\~
 In April 1999, a United States Parcel Service security supervisor reported to ICE that he regularly received packages for Brenda and David McClamma containing unusual electronic devices.\~
 On examination they were found to contain illegal satellite signal intercept devices and Direct TV cards containing hacked computer chips.\~ A search o
f the home of Mr. and Mrs. McClamma in Florida in April 1999 revealed illegally pirated electronic devices designed to intercept US satellite television signals to a value of approximately $778,224.\~
 Mr. and Mrs. McClamma informed agents that they bought the components from the Appellant and BST which was operated by Robert McLaren, his wife Wanda McLaren and Susan Parker-Trudgian.\~ On the 13}{\super\insrsid1064477 th}{\insrsid1064477 
 August 1999 Mr. McClamma (acting in co-operation with ICE) telephoned Mr. McLaren.\~ Mr. McLaren stated that he and
 the Appellant were involved in the distribution of devices designed to intercept television satellite signals and that he and his wife distributed devices for the Appellant.\~ A search by ICE agents on the 30}{\super\insrsid1064477 th}{\insrsid1064477 
 September 1999 of the home addresses of Mr. and Mrs. McLaren and Miss Parker-Trudgian revealed $1,000,000 worth of computer and other electronic equipment designed to intercept US satellite signals.\~
 The agents also discovered invoices which showed that devices were being imported into the United States from the United Kingdom by the Appellant.\~
 During the investigation ICE agents arrested John Dumas who had imported pirated cards form Maxking Interfaces Ltd., a company controlled by the Appellant.\~ Mr. Dumas informed ICE agents that between 1999 and 2000 he was the Appellant\rquote 
s primary distributor of various electronic devices, the function of which was to alter card programming devices to intercept satellite televisions.\~ Mr. Dumas also told the agents that in August 2000 he spoke to Mr. Edmondson, wh

In the extradition proceedings the Appellant relied on this domestic prosecution in support of his contention that his extradition to the United States was barred on the ground of double jeopardy.\~
 On behalf of the Appellant it was submitted that there was a significant overlap between the criminal proceedings in England and the proposed criminal proceedings in the United States and between the devices which were the subject of the Englis
h proceedings and those which form the basis of the US indictment.\~
 In particular, it is maintained that the Appellant could have been charged in the English proceedings with offences of incitement to commit extra-territorial offences by virtue of the Comp
uter Misuse Act 1990 or with offences of the making and selling of unauthorised decoders contrary to section 297A, Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The failure of the prosecution to do so, it is said, renders the request for extradition an abuse o

Before the District Judge it had been submitted that the prosecution in the United Kingdom had been intended to punish the totality of the offending behaviour of the Appellant.\~ The District Judge considered that that statement required qualification.\~
 In his view it was intended to do so in respect of the Appellant\rquote s conduct up to the date of his arrest in November 1998 to the extent that that was known to the investigators.\~
 The Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal had proceeded on the basis that all criminal activity had ceased by November 1998.\~ However the District Judge considered it clear from the documents submitted by the US authorities that the Appellant\rquote 
s activities in America had continued beyond that date, through 1999 into 2000. Accordingly, he concluded that the Appellant\rquote s extradition was not barred on grounds of double jeopardy.

 To my mind, this issue requires consideration not only of whether the second prosecution arises out of the same or substantially the same facts as the first, but also of whether the ch

I have come to the conclusion that the charges in the proposed US proceedings cannot be regarded as arising out of the same or substantially the same facts as the criminal proceeding in England.\~ I have come to this conclusion for the following reasons. 

\par }\pard \qj \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid10103961 {\insrsid1064477

First, the subject matter of the proceedings is substantially different.\~ The US charges are concerned essentially with a conspiracy to defraud 
which took the form of introducing into the United States and there selling and distributing hardware devices and smart cards to individuals for the purpose of providing them with the means of unlawfully obtaining access to direct to home television signa
ls generated by Direct TV, Direct TV/LA and DISH.\~\~ The indictment alleges overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy between June 1997 and May 2002.\~
 The indictment alleges that the Appellant exported from the United Kingdom and imported into the United States the devices necessary to carry out this conspiracy.\~
 By contrast, the prosecution in the United Kingdom related to a totally different subject matter.\~ The offences to which the Appellant pleaded guilty, three offences of incitement to commit an offe
nce contrary to section 3, Computer Misuse Act 1990, were limited to the supply of some twenty devices in the United Kingdom between September and November 1998 for the interception of BSkyB signals.\~
 The alleged offences contrary to section 297A Copyright
, Designs and Patents Act 1988, which were dismissed by the magistrates, and those which were not pursued in the Crown Court related to the manufacture and supply of unauthorised decoders in the United Kingdom which could be used to receive transmissions 
by BSky B.\~
 Although the devices referred to in some of those charges were the MK12 and MK13 devices which were also exported to the United States, it is accepted, on behalf of the Appellant, that these were simply generic devices which would have to be fur
ther adapted before they could be used to intercept signals in the United States. To my mind, the fact of the introduction of the devices into the United States is a critical and essential part of the United States proceedings which focus on the defraudin
g of the US satellite providers.

Secondly, it is clear that the prosecution in England did not include the entirety of the activities of the Appellant and the operation of Maxking Interfaces Limited up to the Appellant\rquote s arrest in November 1998, altho
ugh that may have been the mistaken belief of the authorities in the United Kingdom at the time.

Thirdly, the timescale of the subject matter of the proceedings in England and the United States is different.\~ The English proceedings are limited to conduct in a period of three months, September to November 1998.\~
 The conspiracy to defraud alleged in the United States indictment is alleged to have been in existence between June 1997 and May 2002 although the last overt act alleged to have been performed
 by the Appellant pursuant to the conspiracy is alleged to have occurred on or about the 3}{\super\insrsid1064477 rd}{\insrsid1064477  August 2000.

Fourthly, the difference in scale between the activities which form the subject matter of the English proceedings and the proposed United States proceedings is very striking.\~
 The Appellant pleaded guilty at Doncaster Crown Court on the basis that he had supplied twenty devices over a period of three months in 1998 with a total turnover of some \'a3600.00.\~ By contrast, the search of the home of Mr. 
and Mrs. McClamma in Florida in April 1999 led to the discovery of approximately $778,224 worth of electronics devices designed to intercept US satellite television signals, which, according to Mr. and Mrs. McClamma, they had bought from the Appellant and
 BST.

For these reasons, I consider, that the United States proceedings relate to a distinct and discrete activity.\~ In this regard, the decision of the Divisional Court in }{\b\i\insrsid1064477 Fofana}{\insrsid1064477  is readily distinguishable.\~
 In that case the defendants were charged in England with offences contrary to the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 in respect of their dealings with a French company, Serviware.\~
 The Divisional Court concluded that the only significant addition in the extradition request to the conduct which formed the subject of the criminal proceedings in England was the allegation of almost identical conduct against Serviware a year earlier.\~
 The Divisional Court concluded that the fact that the prosecution had chosen to frame a prosecution on only one transa
ction, notwithstanding that the material in relation to other transactions was available to it, would make it difficult for an English judge to resist an application to stay on grounds of abuse of process a prosecution such as that proposed by the French 
authorities in the extradition proceedings.\~ There was such a significant overlap between the proceedings that the extradition proceedings should be stayed as an abuse of process.\~ The present case, by contrast, concerns wholly distinct activities.\~
 To my mind, the present case resembles very closely, in this regard, the situations under consideration in }{\b\i\insrsid1064477 Boudhiba v Central Examining Court No.5 of the National Court of Justice, Madrid, Spain}{\insrsid1064477 
 [2006] EWHC 167 (Admin.) and }{\b\i\insrsid1064477 Bohning v Government of the United States of America }{\insrsid1064477 [2005] EWHC 2613 (Admin.).

I turn, therefore, to the question whether a prosecution should have been brought in England in 1999 in respect of the activities which now form the subject of the proposed US proceedings.\~
 To my mind, it cannot be said that the proposed proceedings in the United States are an abuse of process because the matters to which it relates should have been the subject of an earlier prosecution in England.\~
 I have come to this conclusion on the following reasons.

\insrsid1064477 I accept that investigations in the United Kingdom and the United States were continuing at the same time.\~ The Appellant was arrested in the United Kingdom in November 1998.\~
 The English proceedings came before the Crown Court in July 2000.\~ The first United States warrant for the arrest of the Appellant was issued on the 1}{\super\insrsid1064477 st}{\insrsid1064477  October 1999.\~ Moreover, it appears that the US prosec
utor was aware of the investigations which were taking place in the United Kingdom.\~

\insrsid1064477 In her submissions Miss Dobbin, on behalf of the Appellant, placed great emphasis on the fact that the MK 12 and MK 13 decoders which were the subject of the charges pursuant to section 297A, Copyright, Designs and Pat
ents Act 1998 dismissed by the magistrates court in Doncaster, are the same decoders which were exported to the United States.\~
 However, during the course of the hearing before us it became apparent that MK 12 and MK 13 devices are generic devices. In the evidence before the District Judge they are described as \'93
flexible general purpose diagnostic tools that allow us to use any personal computer with a serial port to communicate with both smartcards and smartcard accepting devices in a very economic way.\'94 M
iss Dobbin accepted that before these devices could be used to intercept broadcasts in the United States they would require further adaptation.

\insrsid1064477 It is instructive to consider what charges might have been brought in the English proceedings in respect of the activities which are the subject of the proposed United States proceedings.\~
 Miss Dobbin maintains that the Appellant could have been prosecuted in England for making or selling the decoders which were subsequently used to receive transmissions in the United States.\~
 However, the offence under section 297A(1), Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1998 of making or selling an unauthorised decoder must be read subject to section 297A(4) which defines \'93decoder\'94 as \'93any apparatus which is designed or adapted
 to enable (whether on its own or with any other apparatus) an encrypted transmission to be decoded\'94.\~ That subsection defines \'93transmission\'94 as meaning any programme included in a broadcasting service or information society service \'93
which is provided from a place in the United Kingdom or any other member state\'94.\~
 It is clear that apparatus designed or adapted to enable a transmission provided from a place in the United States to be decoded would not fall within the ambit of the offence.\~ So far as the offe
nce of incitement to commit an offence contrary to section 3, Computer Misuse Act 1990 is concerned, I note that section 7(4) of that Act extends the territorial scope of such inchoate offences.\~
 However, while I accept that in theory it might have been po
ssible to bring a prosecution in the United Kingdom in respect of incitement to commit offences in the United States, for the other reasons here stated I am unable to accept that failure to bring such charges in England in 1999 makes the extradition reque
st an abuse of process.

\insrsid1064477 A consideration of particular importance in this regard is the state of knowledge of the United Kingdom authorities in 1999. On behalf of the Appellant great reliance is placed on the fact that the search of the Appellant\rquote s home
 in England in 1998 revealed documents relating to the export of items to United States.\~ We have been provided with a helpful table of documents within the committal relating to sales to the United States.\~
 These include documents relating to supplies to Mr. McLaren.\~
 However, these documents show supplies of a very low volume and at very low prices. There is nothing on the face of the documents seized which would suggest a conspiracy in the United States on anything approaching the scale which is now alle
ged in the United States proceedings. It is clear that the prosecuting authorities in the United Kingdom in 1999 believed that the charges brought represented the totality of the criminal activities of the Appellant. That is apparent, in particular, from 
the judgment of the Court of Appeal on 23}{\super\insrsid1064477 rd}{\insrsid1064477 
 November 2000. On the basis of the allegations now pursued in the United States proceedings, it appears that they were mistaken. When the appeal against sentence was allowed by the Court of Appeal in November 2000 it was on the basis that the Appellant
\rquote s business activities in this field had ceased in November 1998.\~ That was clearly nor the case.

Miss Dobbin, on behalf of the Appellant, submits that the District Judge was in error in limiting his consideration to the passage of time since May 2002.\~ She submits that he should have had regard to the period sin
ce the date of last overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy alleged to have been committed by the Appellant i.e. the period since August 2000.\~
 I am unable to accept this submission. The fact that no overt act is alleged to have been committed by the appellant after that date does not mean that he was no longer a party to the conspiracy.\~ The Appellant\rquote 
s evidence was that he passed the running of the business to Mr. Steven Edmondson in 2000.\~ The District Judge concluded that this was not a sale of the business but simply a transfer of the running of the business.\~
 Accordingly, it may well be that the Appellant remained a party to the conspiracy until May 2002, despite the assurances he gave to the United States authorities in September 2000. Nevertheless, 
under section 82 the court is required to consider whether a person\rquote s extradition would be unjust or oppressive \'93by reason of the passage of time since he is alleged to have committed the offence\'94
. In circumstances such as the present where an offence is a
lleged to have been committed continuously over a considerable period of time, I consider that it is not appropriate to limit consideration of the passage of time to the period since the last date at which that person is alleged to have committed the offe
n
ce. On the contrary it is necessary to have regard to the total passage of time since that person is alleged to have committed the offence. The significance in this regard of different periods of time will vary from case to case, depending on a number of 
factors including the nature of the offence, the course of investigations, the date of detection and the steps taken to secure the extradition of the alleged offender.

In the present case, I consider that it is appropriate to take into account for this purpose the passage of time since September 2000.\~
 I select that date because by then the requesting authorities could reasonably be expected to bring charges and pursue an extradition request in respect of the alleged conspiracy, even if it continued th
ereafter. In that month there took place communications between solicitors acting for the Appellant and the prosecuting authorities in the United States which make clear that by that date the prosecuting authorities in the United States were well aware of
 the activities which form the subject of the proceedings and that it was their intention to seek the extradition of the Appellant in respect thereof.

In the event, the request for the extradition of the Appellant was not made until October 2004. The 
reason for the delay will be relevant to this issue if it has been brought about by the Appellant himself. The Respondent maintains that efforts were made to locate the Appellant and his wife in the United Kingdom but it was discovered that they had reloc
a
ted to Tunisia. No further particulars are provided of the efforts made to trace the Appellant and his wife or the dates at which they were made. In particular, it does not appear that any attempt was made to locate the Appellant through his solicitors, a
lthough the point is fairly made that they may not have been in a position to provide information as to their client\rquote s whereabouts.

In this regard I note that the grand jury did not return an indictment until 14}{\super\insrsid1064477 th}{\insrsid1064477  May 2002. Moreover, the evidence of M
r. Peluso is that it was in November 2003 that investigators discovered that the Appellant and his wife had returned to England from Tunisia. Nevertheless it was almost another year before the request for extradition was made. In these circumstances I do 
not consider that responsibility for the delay which has occurred can fairly be attributed to the Appellant.

I turn therefore to consider whether the extradition of the Appellant would be unjust by reason of passage of time.\~ In his witness statement dated 12}{\super\insrsid1064477 th}{\insrsid1064477 
 December 2005, the Appellant contends that he would now be hindered in fighting this case in the United States because, as a result of the passage of time and the liquidation of Maxking Interfaces Limited, he no longer has access to the witnesse
s or the information he would need to fight the case at trial.\~ By way of example he refers to his inability now to produce e-mail records of conversations with Mr. McLaren and others.\~
 He says that none of the documents relating to his transactions with BST and John Dumas are now available.\~ Furthermore, he contends that even if he could remember the details of the legal advice he took at the time the lawyer\rquote 
s notes of the advice would have been destroyed.\~ He also says that he can no longer remember the names of staff who worked for him who could give evidence about the operation of the business.\~

There are several reasons why I am unable to accept the submission that the Appellant will suffer prejudice at the trial in the United States as a result of the passage of time.\~ First, his claims in his witness statement are wholly unparticularised.\~
 No explanation is provided as to when or what circumstances he ceased to have access to relevant documents.\~ Secondly, certain parts of his evidence are wholly incredible.\~
 I am unable to accept that he can no longer remember the names of the employees who worked for him or that information as to the legal advice he received could no longer be obtained.\~ Thirdly, it is clear from his own evidence that the Appell
ant has known since August 2000 that he was at risk of being extradited to the United States to stand trial on charges relating to his activities in exporting electronic devices to the United States.\~
 If it is the case that he no longer has access to documents relating to these activities that is entirely his responsibility.\~
 Fourthly, in any event, no explanation has been provided by the Appellant as to the relevance of such documents to his defence in the United States proceedings.\~ The Appellant does not deny the supply of the devices to the United States.\~
 Rather, he denies that the supply was illegal.\~ The Appellant maintains that the MK devices supplied by his company were not already programmed with software required to evade paying subscription charges for satellite television.\~
 He maintains that the readers cannot be programmed and are simply hardware interfaces between a smart card and a computer. In these circumstances, I am unable to see how the non-availability of the material which the Appellant
 describes in his witness statement would prejudice such a defence.

In considering whether the extradition of the Appellant would be oppressive by reason of the passage of time since he is alleged to have committed the offence, it is necessary to tak
e account, in the present case, of the state of knowledge of the Appellant as to the possibility that his extradition would be sought.\~
 In his witness statement the Appellant states that after his return from the United States in October 1999, following th
e execution of a search warrant at the home of Mr. and Mrs. McClamma, he was able to obtain a copy of the affidavit in support of the search warrant.\~
 Furthermore, his solicitors made informal enquiries of a prosecuting attorney who confirmed that the offences being investigated were extraditable.\~
 The Appellant was advised that he was believed to be responsible for designing a device to counter signals that broadcasters sent out to prevent unauthorised receipt of signals.\~ The Appellant states that his sol
icitors were able to establish that there was an investigation in the United States which included himself and that the United States authorities wanted to extradite him in relation to those investigations.\~ He also states that on 17}{
\super\insrsid1064477 th}{\insrsid1064477  August 2000 his solicitors spoke with the prosecuting attorney, Mr. Peluso who confirmed that an investigation into the Appellant\rquote 
s business activities was being pursued and that once various steps had been taken with regard to the grand jury and the Department of Justice, an
 application for his extradition would be made. On the instructions of the Appellant, his solicitors wrote to Mr. Peluso on the 22}{\super\insrsid1064477 nd}{\insrsid1064477 
 August 2000 confirming that the selling of MK devices to the United States had stopped as of the 17}{\super\insrsid1064477 th}{\insrsid1064477  August 2000.\~ A further letter dated the 7}{\super\insrsid1064477 th}{\insrsid1064477 
 September 2000 to Mr. Peluso stated that the Appellant would undertake to stop supplying the MK devices to the United States.

Nowhere in his witness statement does the Appellant maintain that he was led to believe that an application for his extradition would not be made.\~
 However, in his oral evidence before the District Judge, the Appellant stated that he had been told by his solicitors that if he stopped selling the devices he would be immune from prosecution.\~ The District Judge rejected this claim.\~
 He was clearly right to do so.\~ If there were any truth in such a claim, it would have featured large in the Appellant\rquote s witness statement.\~ Moreover, in re-examination before the District Judge the Appellant accepted that after
 the correspondence with Mr. Peluso referred to above, the Appellant had had a conversation with his solicitor in which he had asked if he was in the clear.\~\~ She had replied \'93No, but if you comply then you have a good chance\'94.\~
 Accordingly, I conclude that the Appellant was not led to believe that his extradition would not be sought.\~
 On the contrary, he was made aware that his extradition would be requested, although his hopes that such an application might not be pursued, may have increased with the pass
age of time. Before us, Miss Dobbin submitted that there must come a point when one is entitled to assume that one\rquote s extradition is no longer being sought.\~
 However, I consider that in the circumstances of this case that position had not been reached.

Miss Dobbin also drew attention to a number of changes in the Appellant\rquote s life which have occurred since those communications with the US prosecutor which took place in September 2000.\~ They have been substantial.\~
 The Appellant has spent substantial periods of time in Tunisia where he has pursued business interests.\~ His marriage to Mrs. Maxwell-King has been dissolved.\~ He has been made bankrupt in the United Kingdom.\~
 He has remarried a Tunisian national who is now expecting their child early in 2007.\~ He has now secured employment with the BBC.\~ However, to my mind none of these changes in his life would make his extradition to the United States oppressive.\~
 Moreover, at all times since September 2000 the Appellant has been aware that it was the intention of the United States to seek his extradition.

In this regard Miss Dobbin also placed reliance on Article 8, European Convention on Human Rights.\~ In }{\b\i\insrsid1064477 Bermingham}{\insrsid1064477  [2006] EWHC 2000 (Admin) Laws LJ observed (at paragraph 118):

ed extradition for a serious offence will separate him from his family, Article 8(1) is likely to be engaged on the ground that his family life will be interfered with.\~
 The question then will be whether the extradition is nevertheless justified pursuant to Article 8(2).\~ Assuming compliance with all the relevant requirements of domestic law the issue is likely to be one of proportionality:\~
 is the interference with family life proportionate to the legitimate aim of the proposed extradition?\~ Now there is a strong public interest in \'93honouring extradition treaties made with other States\'94 (}{\b\i\insrsid1064477 Ullah}{\insrsid1064477

 Where a proposed extradition is properly constituted according to the domestic law of the sending State and the relevant bilateral treaty, and its execution is resisted on Article 8 grounds, a wholly exceptional ca
