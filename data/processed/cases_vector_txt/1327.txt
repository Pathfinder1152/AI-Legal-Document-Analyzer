Introduction

1. The Claimant, the Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority (“RAKIA”), is the

investment authority of Ras Al Khaimah (“RAK”), one of the seven Emirates making

up the United Arab Emirates (“the UAE”). The Defendant, Farhad Azima, is a US

businessman based in Kansas City, Missouri who has been involved in the aviation

industry for many years.

2. RAKIA was represented at the trial by Hugh Tomlinson Q.C. and Edward Craven.

Mr Azima was represented by Tim Lord Q.C. and Hugo Leith.

3. Between 2007 and 2016, Mr Azima became involved in various actual and proposed

commercial joint ventures with RAKIA and other RAK entities. They included a joint

venture between his company HeavyLift International Airlines FZC (“HeavyLift”)

and RAK Airways for the establishment of a pilot training academy in RAK, the

intended sale of a luxury hotel in Georgia owned by one of RAKIA’s subsidiaries and

a proposed joint venture involving the provision to RAK of aerial intelligence,

surveillance and reconnaissance services.

4. On 2 March 2016 Mr Azima and HeavyLift entered into a settlement agreement with

RAKIA in respect of claims made by Mr Azima and HeavyLift against RAKIA in

connection with the pilot training academy joint venture (“the Settlement

Agreement”). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement RAKIA paid Mr Azima the sum

of $2.6 million.

3

5. RAKIA advances three claims against Mr Azima in these proceedings. The first is

that Mr Azima fraudulently misrepresented the amount of HeavyLift’s investment in

the training academy joint venture and that this misrepresentation induced RAKIA to

enter into the Settlement Agreement and pay Mr Azima $2.6 million (“the HeavyLift

Investment Misrepresentation Claim”). RAKIA is claiming part of this sum by way

of damages under this head.

6. RAKIA’s second claim is a further claim for fraudulent misrepresentation inducing

the Settlement Agreement. It is based on a provision in the Settlement Agreement by

which Mr Azima warranted and confirmed that he had at all times acted in good faith

and with the utmost professional integrity towards RAKIA, RAK Airways and any

other RAK entity and would continue to do so. RAKIA alleges that this provision

(“the Good Faith Clause”) constituted a representation which Mr Azima knew was

false because of his wrongful conduct in connection with various episodes occurring

between 2011 and 2015 (the “Good Faith Misrepresentation Claim”).

7. RAKIA is claiming by way of damages for the Good Faith Misrepresentation Claim

the whole of the sum of $2.6 million which it paid to Mr Azima under the Settlement

Agreement.

8. RAKIA’s third claim is for $1,562,500 by way of damages for an unlawful means

conspiracy arising in connection with the intended sale of the luxury hotel in Georgia

in 2011 - 2012.

9. A fourth pleaded claim, for damages for breach of warranty based on the Good Faith

Clause in the Settlement Agreement, was not pursued by RAKIA in its closing

submissions, RAKIA recognising that, even if breach of warranty were proved, it

would only have a claim for nominal damages.

10. Mr Azima challenges RAKIA’s three remaining claims on two main grounds. First,

he contends that the claims should be struck out or dismissed on the ground that, in

bringing the claims, RAKIA is relying on confidential emails that RAKIA obtained

through its unlawful hacking of his email accounts. Mr Azima has brought a

counterclaim for damages resulting from what he alleges was RAKIA’s hacking of

his emails. That counterclaim has been stayed pending the trial of RAKIA’s claims

against Mr Azima.

11. Second, Mr Azima denies the claims made against him on their merits. He denies

making the alleged representations, denies fraud and denies any reliance by RAKIA

on the representations. He contends that the litigation is politically motivated, the

culmination of a targeted attack on him, pursued because of his refusal to take

RAKIA’s side in a bitter fight with Dr Khater Massaad, a former senior government

official who RAKIA alleges was guilty of large scale embezzlement.

12. RAKIA does not dispute that, in bringing the claims, it is relying on hacked emails

but it contends that it came across the hacked material innocently on publicly

accessible websites where it had been put by anonymous hackers. It contends that, in

any event, the hacking allegations provide no defence to RAKIA’s claims in this

action and that, even if the Court found that the RAKIA was responsible for the

4

hacking, the public interest in the Court reaching the correct decision on the basis of

all the available evidence should prevail.

Factual background

(1) Dr Massaad

13. Dr Massaad was from 2005 until 2012 RAKIA’s chief executive officer. Dr Massaad

was one of the most senior public officials in RAK and was entrusted with the

management and control of RAK’s national and international investments. As

RAKIA’s chief executive officer Dr Massaad had effective control over all of

RAKIA’s affairs, operations, assets and funds and he was directly involved in certain

of the transactions which have given rise to RAKIA’s claims in these proceedings. Dr

Massaad and Mr Azima were friends.

14. RAKIA claims that in around late 2012 it discovered that Dr Massaad had perpetrated

systematic and wide-ranging frauds against RAKIA and other RAK entities.

Subsequent investigations undertaken by the Government of RAK are said to have

established that between around 2005 and 2012 Dr Massaad and his associates

engaged in an unlawful conspiracy to misappropriate monies and otherwise cause

losses exceeding $2 billion. Dr Massaad fled the UAE in 2012 and was subsequently

tried and convicted in absentia of an array of fraud, bribery and embezzlement

offences.

15. In 2015 and 2016, Mr Azima acted as Dr Massaad’s representative in without

prejudice settlement discussions with RAKIA concerning the return of

misappropriated assets. Those discussions ultimately came to nothing and no

agreement was reached between RAKIA and Dr Massaad.

(2) The Training Academy Joint Venture

16. Mr Azima first met Dr Massaad in around 2006 or 2007 in order to discuss the

expansion of RAK’s aviation activities. Mr Azima was introduced to RAK Airways.

Dr Massaad and Mr Azima had a shared interested in aviation and they became

friends. Mr Azima was also introduced to Sheikh Saud, the current ruler of RAK (“the

Ruler”) who was at that time the Crown Prince. There is a peripheral issue as to the

closeness of the relationship between the Ruler and Mr Azima. Mr Azima contends

that they were friends, a contention denied by the Ruler. Mr Azima exhibits an email

exchange of New Year good wishes. From time to time, Mr Azima gave assistance to

the Ruler in the form of effecting introductions to various contacts of his. My

impression is that their relationship was one of mutual convenience rather than

friendship.

17. Dr Massaad introduced Mr Azima to the management of RAK Airways, the national

airline of RAK and discussions ensued about the possibility of establishing a training

academy for pilots in RAK. These discussions led in 2007 to the establishment of a

joint venture between HeavyLift, an aviation company established and owned by Mr

5

Azima, and RAK Airways for the creation and operation of a pilot training academy

at RAK International Airport (the “Training Academy JV”).

18. The parties agreed, amongst other things, that HeavyLift would provide and maintain

a working DC-8 flight simulator and that RAK Airways would construct an

appropriate facility at RAK International Airport to house the simulator. A RAK Free

Zone company, RAK-HeavyLift Training Academy FZ-LLC, was incorporated on 11

April 2007 for the purpose of implementing and running the Training Academy JV.

The directors of the company were Dr Massaad and Mr Azima.

19. The Training Academy JV was not a success. Although the simulator was eventually

certified by several civil aviation authorities and was therefore able to provide some

commercial training services, the partners to the joint venture were in conflict on

various issues from an early stage.

20. Mr Azima’s evidence was that RAK Airways failed to arrange to provide an adequate

electrical power supply or air-conditioning (which was necessary for the operation of

the simulator), a suitable building with the structural capacity and height needed to

accommodate the additional simulators that had been contemplated and that it had

made an unwarranted demand for rent which HeavyLift had no option but to pay. The

Training Academy JV ceased operations in 2010.

21. The failure of the Training Academy JV later gave rise to the claim for compensation

which was the subject of the Settlement Agreement. Mr Azima’s evidence was that

the Training Academy JV’s failure was attributable to RAK Airways. This was not

admitted by RAKIA.

(3) The Hotel

22. A Georgian subsidiary of RAKIA, Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority Georgia

LLC (“RAKIA Georgia”), owned a luxury hotel, the Sheraton Metechi Palace Hotel

in Tbilisi, Georgia (the “Hotel”). In 2011, RAKIA decided to sell the Hotel. The

intended sale transaction is one of the episodes relied on by RAKIA in support of its

claim that Mr Azima was guilty of wrongful conduct contrary to the Good Faith

Clause in the Settlement Agreement.

23. Mr Azima received two payments of $400,000 and $1,162,500 on 25 October 2011

and 18 January 2012 respectively and, on the day that he received the latter of those

payments, Mr Azima made a payment of $500,000 to Dr Massaad. Mr Azima’s case

is that he was entitled to both payments under a referral agreement with RAKIA (“the

Referral Agreement”) as commission for introducing to RAKIA three Iranians who

were potential buyers of the Hotel (“the Potential Buyers”) and that the payment to Dr

Massaad was in return for a share in an aircraft owned by Dr Massaad. This version of

events is disputed by RAKIA which contends that the Referral Agreement is a sham,

that Mr Azima did not introduce the Potential Buyers, that the two payments which

he received were misappropriations and that his payment to Dr Massaad was a bribe.

6

24. There is a further dispute concerning an agreement between the Potential Buyers and

Mr Azima under which he was to receive a 10% interest in the Hotel in exchange for

a nominal payment of $10 “and other good and valuable consideration”. Mr Azima

claims that RAKIA and the Ruler were aware of and approved this arrangement. This

is disputed by the Ruler and RAKIA.

25. Following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between RAKIA

Georgia and Eurasia Hotel Holdings Limited (a company beneficially owned by the

Potential Buyers), the sale of the Hotel proceeded to a different company owned by

them but was never completed. Mr Azima ceased to be involved in the sale

transaction. The timing of, and reasons for, Mr Azima’s withdrawal are disputed.

(4) HeavyLift’s compensation claim

26. HeavyLift’s claim for compensation from RAKIA arising out of the Training

Academy JV was first made on 2 September 2013 when Ray Adams acting on behalf

of Mr Azima sent a letter to the then Chief Executive Officer of RAKIA, Jim Stewart,

concerning “unresolved” matters regarding the Training Academy JV.

27. A few months before the claims were first made, Mr Azima and Mr Adams arranged

for the drafting of what purported to be a copy of a Joint Venture Agreement dated

12 April 2007 (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) including RAKIA as a guarantor of

RAK Airways’ obligations. The circumstances in which the Joint Venture Agreement

was produced is considered further at paragraphs 123 – 128 below.

28. HeavyLift’s claim for compensation was not dealt with in 2013 and Mr Azima did

not press the matter for the next 22 months. The claim was resurrected in July 2015.

Between July 2015 and March 2016 there were correspondence and discussions

regarding potential claims that HeavyLift had against RAKIA arising from the

Training Academy JV. During the course of those discussions, it was represented that

HeavyLift had invested $2.6m in the assets of the Training Academy JV including

expenditure of $1,726,000 on the simulator. This representation is alleged to have

been made fraudulently and has given rise to the HeavyLift Investment

Misrepresentation Claim. The alleged misrepresentation is also relied on by RAKIA

as wrongful conduct on the part of Mr Azima contrary to the Good Faith Clause in

the Settlement Agreement.

(5) The planned media and PR campaign

29. In late 2014 and 2015 plans were made by consultants acting for Dr Massaad to

organise a media and public relations campaign which was intended to damage the

reputation of RAKIA, RAK and other RAK entities. RAKIA contends that Mr Azima

played a leading role in the planned campaign and that the campaign was malicious

and intended to spread false stories about human rights violations in RAK. This

episode is relied on by RAKIA as giving rise to further wrongful conduct on the part

of Mr Azima, contrary to the Good Faith Clause; RAKIA’s allegations are disputed

7

by Mr Azima.

(6) The Project Update and its aftermath

30. By late 2014 investigations were under way within RAK into the actions of Dr

Massaad and his associates.

31. In January 2015 Stuart Page, a private investigator, was engaged by the Ruler to

investigate what the Ruler feared was a plot between a member of his family and Dr

Massaad aimed at destabilising his rulership.

32. In March 2015 Mr Page provided the Ruler with a report entitled RAK Project Update

(“the Project Update”) which was mainly concerned with Dr Massaad’s activities but

which also described how Mr Azima was managing a team of advisers in the US,

hired by Dr Massaad, who were planning to spread allegations about human rights

issues in RAK; their campaign had not yet been made public. Mr Page’s agents who

compiled the report said that they would be able to gather intelligence on the

campaign team in order to monitor their progress and “attempt to contain or ruin their

plans”.

33. In around April 2015, the Ruler told Mr Buchanan that he wanted Mr Buchanan and

other assistants to “target” Mr Azima. The Ruler directed his associates to bring

charges against Mr Azima. The Ruler's associates discussed meeting to "coordinate

our attack" on Mr Azima and Dr Massaad but persuaded the Ruler not to pursue this

plan at that time.

34. In or around July 2015, the Ruler instructed another of his assistants, Naser Al

Bustami, to "go after" Mr Azima. Mr Azima’s case is that, just as Henry II’s question

“Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?” led to the murder of Thomas Becket, so

the Ruler’s directions to “go after” Mr Azima led in due course to the hacking of Mr

Azima’s emails, whether or not this was the Ruler’s express instruction.

(7) The hacking of Mr Azima’s emails

35. A ‘phishing’ email is an email that seeks to trick the recipient into clicking on a

hyperlink taking the user to a webpage that the criminal controls, or into downloading

malicious software. A ‘spear-phishing’ email is a more targeted and sophisticated

form of a ‘phishing’ email which indicates that the sender has purposely targeted the

deception at that individual (as shown by the fact that the email has been constructed

to include material pertinent to the recipient, or otherwise to be of more interest to

them). The fact that the spear-phishing email contains material of particular interest to

the targeted recipient makes it more likely to be effective in that the recipient is more

likely to open the deceptive email and any further links it may contain.

36. It is common ground that in October 2015 Mr Azima received a number of spear-

phishing emails. Mr Azima’s case is that these spear-phishing emails led at the time to

the hacking of his confidential email accounts, that the hacking was organised by

agents acting on behalf of RAKIA and that consequently by late 2015 RAKIA had

8

accessed his confidential emails and the evidence which it now relies on in support of

its claims. RAKIA denies that it had anything to do with the spear-phishing emails and

does not admit that the spear-phishing emails led to the hacking of Mr Azima’s email

accounts.

37. On 29 December 2015 a document called the “View from the Window” was drawn

up by Andrew Frank, an employee of Karv Communications, a PR firm engaged by

RAK. The document referred to Mr Azima as “having orchestrated, if not fully

participated in numerous fraudulent activities” and to “companies being set up with

Iranian nationals”. Mr Azima contends that this document shows that RAKIA had by

this stage obtained access to Mr Azima’s confidential emails and data. This is

disputed by RAKIA.

(8) The Settlement Agreement

38. On 2 March 2016 RAKIA, HeavyLift and Mr Azima entered into the Settlement

Agreement. The Recitals to the Settlement Agreement read as follows:

“(A) By an agreement dated 12 April 2007, HeavyLift and RAK

Airways PJSC (“RAK Airways”) entered into a joint venture (the

“Joint Venture Agreement”) to establish an Aircraft Simulator and

Training Facility at Ras Al Khaimah International Airport, located

in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE (“RAK”);

(B) RAKIA guaranteed the performance of RAK Airways under the

Joint Venture Agreement;

(C) HeavyLift, acting through Mr Azima, has asserted that RAK

Airways owes HeavyLift for investments HeavyLift made in the

joint venture pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement;

(D) RAKIA does not agree that there is any legal basis for any such

claim;

(E) Mr. Azima has recently provided negotiation assistance to

RAKIA on an informal basis which RAKIA recognises and

appreciates;

(F) Each Party has the greatest of respect for the other Parties, and

wishes to resolve all outstanding issues relating to the Joint Venture

Agreement.”

39. Clause 1.1 required RAKIA to pay the sum of $2.6 million in settlement of any

claims that Mr Azima or HeavyLift might have had against RAKIA or another RAK

entity:

“RAKIA will pay HeavyLift the sum of $2,600,000 to resolve all

claims which Mr Azima or HeavyLift may have against it or any

other RAK Entity as further detailed in paragraph 3.1.”

40. RAKIA’s case is that it was deceived into entering the Settlement Agreement by

fraudulent misrepresentations made by and on behalf of Mr Azima regarding the

amount of HeavyLift’s investment, that the settlement sum of $2.6m was intended to

9

reflect the amount spent by HeavyLift in making its contribution to the Training

Academy JV and that the true amount of HeavyLift’s investment was significantly

smaller than this.

41. In exchange for the payment of $2.6m, Mr Azima and HeavyLift agreed to relinquish

any claims they had against RAKIA or any other RAK entity. Clause 3.1 of the

Settlement Agreement stated as follows:

“This Settlement Agreement is in full and final settlement of all

claims, in any jurisdiction, whether or not presently known to them

or to the law that Mr Azima or HeavyLift or any of its owners has

had, shall or may have against RAKIA, RAK Airways or any other

RAK Entity.”

42. Clause 3.2 of the Settlement Agreement, the Good Faith Clause, provided as follows:

“Mr Azima and HeavyLift each expressly and separately warrants

and confirms to RAKIA that he/it (respectively) has at all times acted

in good faith and with the utmost professional integrity and will

continue in the future to act in good faith and with the utmost

professional integrity towards RAKIA, RAK Airways and any other

RAK Entity.

The payment made to HeavyLift pursuant to this Settlement

Agreement is made in reliance on this express warranty and

confirmation.

For the purposes of this Sub-clause, “acted in good faith” and “act in

good faith” each means (1) participating in conduct which meets the

standard expected of reasonable business persons in the context and

includes acting in ways which were or are, or are likely to be, non-

detrimental to the interests of RAKIA or any other RAK Entity, and

(2) not encouraging others to participate in the conduct which fails

to meet the standard expected of reasonable business persons in the

context or acting in ways which were or are likely to be detrimental

to the interests of RAKIA or any other RAK Entity and (3) not

participating in any illegal activity.

In this Agreement “RAK Entity” shall mean any entity in which

RAKIA or the Government of RAK has a shareholding interest

(irrespective of where that entity may be incorporated).”

43. Clause 4 provided that the Settlement Agreement did not constitute an admission of

liability or wrongdoing by either party. Clause 7 was a governing law and jurisdiction

clause:

“This Settlement Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of,

or in connection with, it or its subject matter or formation (including,

10

without limitation, any contractual or non-contractual disputes,

claims or obligations) is governed by and shall be construed in

accordance with English law and the Parties submit to the exclusive

jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.”

44. Mr Azima’s case is that the Settlement Agreement was a device cynically entered into

by RAKIA which insisted on the inclusion of the Good Faith Clause and an English

jurisdiction clause, while at the same time harbouring a conviction, informed by

surveillance and other covert sources, that he was not acting in good faith. He states

that in doing so, RAKIA sought to use Mr Azima in its dispute with Dr Massaad: it

believed the Settlement Agreement gave it leverage over Mr Azima, insurance to

recover the funds paid (which were modest compared to the $2 billion it was seeking

to recover from Dr Massaad), and possibly the means of turning Mr Azima against

Dr Massaad.

45. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, on 7 April 2016, RAKIA paid the

settlement sum of $2.6m to Mr Azima.

(9) The proposed ISR Joint Venture

46. Alongside the negotiations concerning the Settlement Agreement, in late 2015 and

early 2016 RAKIA was also engaged in discussions with Mr Azima and other

individuals with whom he was collaborating regarding a proposed joint venture for

the provision of aerial intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance services (“ISR

services”) (“the Proposed ISR JV”). RAKIA relies on alleged wrongful conduct in

connection with the Proposed ISR JV in support of its Good Faith Misrepresentation

Claim.

47. The proposed partners for the Proposed ISR JV were RAKIA and Global Defence

Services Corporation (“GDS”), a company of which Mr Azima was a director and

shareholder. RAKIA alleges that Mr Azima made misrepresentations to RAKIA in

the course of the negotiations and failed to correct other false representations made

by the individuals with whom he was collaborating. This is disputed by Mr Azima.

48. The negotiations concerning the Proposed ISR JV ultimately came to an end around

June 2016 and it did not proceed.

(10) The July 2016 meeting

49. Between the autumn of 2015 and July 2016 Mr Azima represented Dr Massaad in

negotiations with RAKIA concerning RAKIA’s entitlement to redress. During the

course of those negotiations, Mr Azima attended meetings (which took place on a

without prejudice basis) with Mr Buchanan and (in some instances) RAKIA’s legal

representatives at Dechert LLP (including Mr Neil Gerrard) on various dates in 2015

and 2016.

50. On 16 July 2016, a without prejudice meeting took place between Mr Buchanan, Mr

11

Gerrard and Mr Azima. This meeting took an acrimonious turn. There is an issue as

to precisely what was said. According to Mr Azima, Mr Gerrard threatened him that

if Dr Massaad could not be made to agree to a settlement, then RAKIA would pursue

Dr Massaad, and Mr Azima would be rendered “collateral damage”. This is disputed

by RAKIA.

(11) The downloading of the hacked material

51. The dispute with Dr Massaad was not resolved. RAKIA admits to creating websites

attacking Dr Massaad a few days after the July 2016 meeting and shortly after those

sites were created, in early August 2016, blogging websites began appearing

denigrating Mr Azima as a “fraud” and a “scammer” and linking to websites

containing Mr Azima’s confidential emails which appeared at around the same time.

52. There is an issue as to how these blogging web sites came to the attention of RAKIA.

RAKIA’s case is that they were discovered by a journalist, Majdi Halabi, who drew

them to the attention of Mr Page, by whom Mr Halabi had been allegedly asked to look

out for references to Mr Azima on the internet. Mr Page is alleged to have

communicated the information to Mr Gerrard and Mr Buchanan. Mr Azima contends

that this version of events is fictitious, that Mr Halabi played no part in the discovery

of the blogging web sites and that RAKIA’s account of the discovery of the blogging

websites is designed to conceal RAKIA’s role in the hacking.

53. RAKIA subsequently instructed an independent third party, Northern Technology

Inc. (“NTi”) to download the material from these links and others which were

subsequently discovered and which RAKIA contends had been posted by unknown

hackers. The material was downloaded by NTi in August and September 2016.

54. RAKIA’s case is that the subsequent analysis of the internet data established that,

contrary to the Good Faith Clause, Mr Azima had in fact committed multiple acts of

serious wrongdoing towards RAKIA and other RAK entities and that, as a result of

that discovery, the present action was commenced on 30 September 2016.

55. On Mr Azima’s case, RAKIA already had access to the hacked data by late 2015 so

that the downloading process in August/September 2016 was a charade.

56. On the same day as these proceedings were commenced (30 September 2016) Mr

Azima brought proceedings against RAKIA in the US District Court for the District of

Columbia alleging that RAKIA had hacked his computers. RAKIA challenged the

proceedings on jurisdictional grounds. Its challenge failed in the US District Court

but on 18 June 2019 the US Court of Appeals allowed RAKIA’s appeal and

dismissed the US proceedings.

57. Mr Azima amended his defence in these proceedings on 18 July 2018 to allege that

RAKIA was responsible for hacking his computers and emails and publishing their

contents on the Internet and on 8 August 2019 was given permission to add a

Counterclaim for damages and other relief arising out of the alleged hacking which

was stayed pending final judgment on RAKIA’s claim.

58. RAKIA served witness statements from twelve witnesses, nine of whom gave oral

evidence. The evidence of two of the witnesses, Richard Garcia and Jessica Gray,

who were involved in the downloading of data from the BitTorrent sites, was

uncontroversial and admitted by Mr Azima without cross-examination.

59. The Ruler of RAK, Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, provided a witness statement

responding to Mr Azima’s first witness statement but did not attend the hearing.

RAKIA submitted that for the Ruler to attend the hearing or appear by video link

would be incompatible with this constitutional role and status as sovereign ruler. It is

regrettable that the Ruler chose not to attend the hearing or give evidence by video

link as there were a number of issues on which he could have given relevant evidence.

As the Ruler’s witness statement was not tested by cross-examination, I do not

propose to attach significant weight to it.

60. Jamie Buchanan was RAKIA’s main witness. Between September 2014 and

December 2019 when he took retirement, Mr Buchanan was the chief executive of

Ras Al Khaimah Development LLC (“RAK Dev”) which holds the assets and

liabilities that were previously owned by RAKIA.

61. Counsel for Mr Azima submitted that Mr Buchanan gave dishonest evidence on a

number of issues relating to Mr Azima’s hacking clam. In relation to one matter,

namely Mr Buchanan’s claim to have been mistaken, until shortly before the trial, as

to the authorship of the Project Update, which I address at paragraph 266 below, I

consider that Mr Buchanan’s evidence was disingenuous. I was not persuaded that

Mr Buchanan’s evidence was dishonest in other respects. He struck me as a generally

reliable witness who gave his evidence in a measured way and was prepared to

concede a number of points adverse to RAKIA’s case that were put to him in cross

examination.

62. Neil Gerrard is a former policeman and a partner in the firm of Dechert LLP which

was instructed to assist with the investigation into Dr Massaad’s alleged fraudulent

activities which it has continued to work on to the present time. His witness statement

dealt with his engagement by RAK, the meeting he had with Mr Azima in July 2016

and the events in August 2016 surrounding the downloading of the hacked material.

He was cross-examined about his involvement with the questioning of detainees

within RAK, in particular Karam Al Sadeq and Shahab Izadpanah. Allegations that

Mr Gerrard had attempted, on behalf of RAK, to extort money from Mr Izadpanah

and had offered Mr Izadpanah and Mr Al Sadeq to drop all charges against them if

they confessed to charges implicating Dr Massaad were put to Mr Gerrard who denied

them in forthright terms. On the basis of the material before me, I am not in a position

13

to make any findings in relation to those allegations or other allegations of misconduct

extraneous to the events in issue in these proceedings that were put to Mr Gerrard.

63. Counsel for Mr Azima submitted that Mr Gerrard gave dishonest evidence on key

issues. He was also criticised for not referring to Mr Page and the Project Update in

his witness statement. In my view, Mr Gerrard’s witness statement should have dealt

with the Project Update which was a clearly relevant document and one which, as he

accepted in cross-examination, was of concern to him when it was produced because

it referred to the threat of a press campaign to smear RAK and its Ruler with human

rights allegations. I do not, however, regard the omission to deal with the Project

Update, or the other criticisms made of his evidence, as leading to the conclusion that I

should treat Mr Gerrard as dishonest.

64. Stuart Page, also a former policeman and now the Chairman and majority shareholder

of a business providing security and surveillance services, dealt in his witness

statement with his engagement in RAK to assist with the investigations into Dr

Massaad and the discovery of the hacked material. Counsel for Mr Azima submitted

that Mr Page was a dishonest witness who lied about a number of matters. I consider

that Mr Page was an unsatisfactory and unreliable witness. As set out in greater detail

in the context of the hacking claim, his witness statement was misleading in relation

to two significant matters. First, his witness statement implied that he did not produce

written reports for the Ruler on his investigations whereas in fact he did so on a

regular basis. Second, his witness statement said that he first came across the name of

Mr Azima in early 2016 whereas in it was in fact a year earlier. His evidence in

connection with the discovery of the hacked material was both internally inconsistent

and at odds with the contemporary documents. I have concluded that it would be

unsafe to rely on any evidence from Mr Page that was not corroborated by some other

source.

65. Amir Ali Handjani is on the board of RAK Petroleum and was involved in discussions

with Mr Buchanan and Mr Bustami regarding both the money that Mr Azima said

was owed to him and matters involving Dr Massaad. Mr Azima criticised him as an

evasive witness giving further dishonest evidence. Mr Handjani was criticised for his

contention that the Ruler’s instruction to “go after” Mr Azima was in part prompted

by a demand for payment of $8 million by Mr Azima. I do not regard the evidence on

this point to be so clear cut as to justify the inference that he gave deliberately false

evidence on it.

66. Naser Al Bustami sits on the boards of a number of companies owned by the

government of RAK and is one of the Ruler’s advisers. He was criticised for an email

proposing that the Government of Georgia be enlisted to support RAKIA’s claims

against Dr Massaad. It is not clear from the email what assistance Mr Bustami had in

mind and his oral evidence was that the assistance sought would be subject to Dr

Massaad being convicted in a fair trial in a court of law. Even accepting that the email

was improper, I do not consider that it supports the inference that Mr Bustami was a

dishonest witness.

67. Majdi Halabi gave evidence in relation to the discovery of the hacked material. As

set out later in this judgment, I came to the conclusion that his evidence was inherently

14

implausible and not credible.

68. Stuart Leach ran the specialist litigation division at the public relations agency Bell

Pottinger at the relevant time. Dave King is the Chief Executive of Digitalis, an online

reputation and digital risk management firm, who were engaged by Bell Pottinger. I

consider that they were both reliable witnesses who were seeking to assist the court.

69. Nicholas del Rosso gave evidence as to his involvement in retaining NTi to download

the Hacked Material from the BitTorrent sites. His evidence was uncontroversial.

70. For Mr Azima, there were three witnesses. First there was Mr Azima himself. Second

there was Mr Adams, a close friend and confidant of Mr Azima who deals with the

accounts and paperwork for Mr Azima’s business, who provided a short witness

statement expressing agreement with Mr Azima’s first witness statement. Finally

there was Professor Donald Fowler, a friend of Mr Azima, who did not appear at the

trial but provided an unchallenged witness statement describing an assignment that

he had carried out for the Ruler at Mr Azima’s request.

71. Mr Azima is a businessman with more than forty years’ experience in all aspects of

aviation, the airline industry and logistics. He has served as chairman of various

airlines in different parts of the world. I am told that he has never before faced an

allegation of fraud. RAKIA submitted that Mr Azima and Mr Adams were dishonest

witnesses. After hearing evidence from Mr Azima and Mr Adams, I reached the

conclusion that their evidence in opposition to RAKIA’s claims was frequently

inconsistent with the contemporaneous documents and inherently implausible. One

example was their evidence concerning the retrospective drafting of the Joint Venture

Agreement, which I deal with at paragraphs 123 to 128 below. I consider that Mr

Azima and Mr Adams, in giving evidence, were more concerned to support Mr

Azima’s case than to assist the court with an honest recollection of the true facts.

72. The two expert witnesses, in the field of Computer Forensics and Investigations, were

Christopher Tarbell (for Mr Azima) who is Director of Cyber Security and

Investigations in the New York office of BRG, a global consulting firm, and Winston

Krone (for RAKIA), who is Global Managing director in the Amsterdam office of

Kivu Consulting Inc, a global technology firm. The experts each produced an expert

report and together a joint report. The parties agreed that the experts, between whom

there was a large measure of agreement, would not be called to give oral evidence.

Documentary evidence

73. Mr Azima made wide ranging criticisms of RAKIA’s documentary evidence and

invited me to draw inferences against RAKIA on the ground that it had destroyed

relevant documents.

74. Mr Buchanan’s disclosure statement referred to an incident at the Covent Garden

Apple store on 16 October 2016 when a substantial number of emails had been

inadvertently deleted from his iPhone by an Apple employee. In witness statements

filed for the purposes of an interim application before HHJ McCahill QC, it was

15

explained that Mr Buchanan had attended the Apple store because of a problem in

sending emails from his phone. On 22 October 2016, six days later, Mr Buchanan

was informed of the need to preserve documents, whereupon he informed Dechert of

the possible deletion of emails. Steps were then taken to address the situation by

restoring the deleted emails but these were only partially successful.

75. It was submitted for Mr Azima that it was “very likely” that Mr Buchanan deliberately

destroyed emails. It was said that Mr Buchanan’s account of the loss of his emails

was inherently implausible, given that an employee would not have worked on his

iPhone without first ensuring that there was a back-up of data. My attention was also

drawn to the absence of corroborative evidence from the witness who Mr Buchanan

said for the first time in cross-examination was with him at the time of the incident.

Furthermore, according to Mr Buchanan’s evidence, there were no deletions as a

result of the incident on 16 October 2016 from his inbox or its sub folders. It was said

that this could not be reconciled with the number of emails (more than 20%) that had

disappeared from his inbox. Practically all of Mr Buchanan’s “sent” items are

unavailable.

76. Mr Buchanan was cross-examined about the emails missing from his inbox as well as

about correspondence with his solicitors in August 2017 when he was asked about his

emails and failed to mention the Apple shop episode. Mr Buchanan was adamant that

he had not used the Apple shop episode as cover for prior deletions of potentially

damaging material. I accept Mr Buchanan’s evidence on this point and conclude that

he had not deliberately destroyed any emails.

77. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Azima that there were other “huge gaps” in the

documentary evidence. I have addressed certain specific criticisms of RAKIA’s

documentation later in this Judgment. I was not persuaded that RAKIA had adopted a

policy of deliberately destroying documents or withholding documents that should

have been disclosed.

The HeavyLift Investment Misrepresentation Claim

78. RAKIA’s case, shortly stated, is as follows.

78.1 In order to induce RAKIA to pay him compensation, Mr Azima repeatedly

represented that HeavyLift had spent a total of $2,685,000 in making its

contribution to the Training Academy JV, including expenditure of

approximately $1,726,000 in respect of the flight simulator (“the HeavyLift

Investment Representation”).

78.2 This was untrue. HeavyLift’s actual expenditure on the Training Academy JV

was very much less – between $850,000 and $1.2 million.

78.3 Mr Azima knew that the HeavyLift Investment Representation was untrue and

that the amount invested by HeavyLift was substantially lower than the sum

represented.

78.4 RAKIA suffered loss as a result of entering into the Settlement Agreement.

16

79. Mr Azima’s response to this claim was, in summary, as follows.

79.1 In 2008 HeavyLift quantified the contribution it had made to the joint venture

on a fair and honest basis that was well understood both by its joint venture

partner and its auditors. The same figures were presented in 2013. This is

incompatible with RAKIA’s fraud case.

79.2 Read in context, the representations in 2013 and 2015 complained of by

RAKIA do not have the meaning attributed to them. The communications

identified the estimated value of the land and building at the airport which

RAK Airways was obliged to contribute to the joint venture (title to which it

failed to transfer) and the value of the investments contributed by HeavyLift

to the joint venture, which included the value of the flight simulator, once

installed and in operation, as well as other assets on which HeavyLift incurred

costs.

79.3 The representations were made by HeavyLift, not by Mr Azima personally.

79.4 RAKIA has failed to prove that the representations were false, i.e. that the out

of pocket costs actually incurred by HeavyLift on the simulator and training

aids were less than represented.

79.5 There was no fraudulent intent.

79.6 There was no reliance by RAKIA.

79.7 RAKIA is only entitled to damages representing the difference between the

costs actually incurred by HeavyLift and the level of costs that the Court finds

were represented as having been incurred.

80. RAKIA’s claim therefore gives rise to the following main issues:

80.1 Was the quantification in 2008 of HeavyLift’s contribution to the joint venture

fair and honest?

80.2 What was the content of the representations to RAKIA in 2013 to 2015?

80.3 Which party made the representations?

80.4 Was the HeavyLift Investment Representation false?

80.5 Was Mr Azima aware that the HeavyLift Investment Representation was false?

80.6 Did RAKIA rely on the HeavyLift Investment Representation?

80.7 What loss has been suffered?

(1) Was the quantification in 2008 of HeavyLift’s contribution to the joint venture

17

fair and honest?

The HeavyLift management accounts

81. From early 2008, HeavyLift had sought to prepare a set of joint financial accounts

with RAK Airways, for submission to HeavyLift’s auditors,

PriceWaterhouseCoopers (‘PwC’), and informed RAK Airways of this. In February

2008 it submitted to RAK Airways a proposed balance sheet contained in preliminary

management accounts, showing HeavyLift’s contribution.

82. The balance sheet showed total assets contributed by HeavyLift of $2,281,883

including an amount of $1,725,959 in respect of “Simulator (includes delivery,

installation & certification)” and an entry for $450,000 in respect of “Training Aids”.

83. At around the same time, a more detailed spreadsheet was prepared by Mr Adams.

That spreadsheet (which was not sent to RAKIA or RAK Airways) contained a tab

(entitled “Simulator”) in respect of the costs associated with the acquisition, storage,

installation and certification of the simulator. This showed how the entry of

$1,725,959 in the preliminary balance sheet had been calculated. According to the

spreadsheet:

83.1 HeavyLift had spent a total of $725,959 in respect of “Simulator Freight &

Storage Charges” and “Simulator Installation Cost” (which included “Outside

Contractors”, “Salaries & Benefits”, “Travel & Accommodation Charges”,

“Legal & Administration Charges”, “License & Permits”, “Parts & Supplies”

and “Supervision”). This total included $186,445 in respect of

“Administration Charges HL”.

83.2 The “Simulator Cost” was recorded as $1 million. This comprised the actual

purchase price of $167,500 paid by HeavyLift to MK Airlines plus a further

unspecified “Investment” by HeavyLift of $832,500. No further details

regarding the nature of that “Investment” were recorded, although it is clear

from the spreadsheet that it did not relate to the costs of storing, installing and

certifying the simulator (which costs were in the $725,959 described above).

84. Mr Azima and Mr Adams gave differing and unsatisfactory explanations regarding

the “Investment” of $832,500. Mr Azima stated that it represented “time, material,

equipment, money.” When it was pointed out to him that all of those expenses were

recorded separately elsewhere in the spreadsheet, Mr Azima said that he could not

address the numbers and that the numbers were produced under the supervision of

Mr Adams. Mr Adams initially stated that the investment reflected the fact that Mr

Azima had issued an invoice for this amount:

“Q. So what does it mean by “investment”?

A. It means that Mr Azima owned 100% of HeavyLift and he contributed that

value to HeavyLift.

Q. In what sense did he contribute it, Mr Adams?

A. He wrote a bill of sale, he gave an invoice.”

18

85. When it was pointed out to Mr Adams that at this point in time Mr Azima had not

produced any invoice for the simulator, he asserted that the $832,500 was an “agreed

value”.

The alleged $1m agreed valuation

86. Mr Azima’s evidence was that a $1 million valuation of the simulator had been

discussed and agreed between HeavyLift and Dr Massaad on behalf of RAKIA, after

the simulator was purchased but before it was installed.

87. There are no contemporaneous documents that support the existence of this alleged

agreement. There are no references to such an agreement in any of the

communications between HeavyLift and RAK Airways during the lifetime of the

Training Academy JV, including communications specifically concerning the value

of the simulator. There was no reference to the alleged agreement in the discussions

with RAKIA in 2015 culminating in the conclusion of the Settlement Agreement.

The only document to contain any reference to this alleged agreement is a draft letter to

Dr Massaad dated 24 January 2008 but there is no evidence that this letter was ever

actually signed by Mr Azima and no documentary evidence that it was actually sent to

Dr Massaad or to any other employee of RAK Airways or RAKIA.

88. When asked during cross-examination why none of the contemporaneous

communications with RAK Airways contained any mention of an agreement that the

simulator would be valued at $1 million for the purposes of valuing HeavyLift’s

contribution, Mr Azima claimed that Dr Massaad had told him “don’t discuss that

with anybody” and had said that “if there’s a problem, come and see me”. Mr Azima

also claimed that, “There’s an email to that effect” although no such email had been

disclosed. Mr Azima did not explain why Dr Massaad would have instructed him not

to talk to anyone at RAK Airways about what was (on Mr Azima’s case) a perfectly

valid and straightforward agreement between the two joint venture partners.

89. Taking this evidence into account, I am not persuaded that there was any agreement

with RAK Airways or RAKIA that the simulator would be valued at $1 million. I

consider that the draft letter was probably created by Mr Adams to support the entry in

the accounts but which did not accord with the true position.

Backdated documents

90. Following Mr Adams’ submission of the preliminary balance sheet, on 19 March

2008 Mr P.B. Hegde, an employee in the Finance Department of RAK Airways,

emailed Mr Adams requesting the provision of further documents concerning

HeavyLift’s investment in the training academy, including “Copy of the Agreement

and Invoice for the purchase of Simulator from MK Airlines” and “Copy of the

Agreement and Invoice for the purchase of Training Aids”.

91. Mr Adams forwarded Mr Hegde’s email to Mr Azima and stated: “Here is the email

from Hegde. We need to have a clear strategy on this.”

19

92. This request for documents prompted Mr Adams and Mr Azima to produce a number

of backdated documents designed to provide support for the figures shown in the

balance sheet in respect of the simulator and the training aids.

92.1 On 27 February 2008, Mr Adams sent an email to Mr Azima attaching several

backdated documents. Mr Adams stated that the documents “requir[e] your

signature” and he requested “color scans of each” once Mr Azima had signed

them. The email made it clear that the documents were intended to be

backdated.

92.2 The backdated documents which Mr Azima was requested to sign included a

“Bill of Sale from you to HeavyLift for the DC8 Training Aids.” Mr Adams

asked Mr Azima to “Please date this 31 December 2007 when you execute it”.

The “Bill of Sale” purported to show that Mr Azima had sold “DC8 training

aids” to HeavyLift for “$10 and other good and valuable consideration” on 31

December 2007. In fact Mr Azima had not sold any training aids to HeavyLift

on 31 December 2007.

92.3 On 27 February 2008, Mr Adams also drafted a letter from Mr Azima to Amir

Anway (HeavyLift’s Financial Controller) which was backdated to 31 October

2007 and which stated:

“I hereby confirm that additional consideration totalling $832,500 from

me was part of the total consideration for the acquisition of the Singer

Link DC8 Simulator from MK Airlines.”

92.4 Mr Adams asked Mr Azima to sign and return the backdated letter. Two weeks

later, on 11 March 2008, Mr Adams re-sent the letter to Mr Azima stating:

“You may have already signed this but I did not get a copy of it. Hegde has

asked to review all of the costs we have booked and I really don't want to be

without some basis for booking the sim at $1,000,000 when he goes through

the books. Please sign and give the original to Amir and send me a copy.”

93. I accept RAKIA’s contention that the backdated letter was a misleading document. It

was not written (or sent) on the date shown on its face and Mr Azima did not provide

“additional consideration” of $832,500 (or any additional consideration) for the

purchase of the simulator. Mr Adams accepted during cross-examination that this

letter was backdated although he insisted that the document was not misleading, on the

basis that it was perfectly acceptable to backdate accounting documents for an audit.

Mr Azima made a similar statement in his evidence.

94. Mr Adams was asked to explain why, if Mr Azima and RAK Airways had agreed

that the simulator would be valued at $1 million, Mr Adams did not simply inform

RAK Airways of this, rather than creating a backdated letter regarding the payment of

“additional consideration”. Mr Adams could not answer this, merely stating, “I don’t

know”.

95. Also on 22 March 2008, Mr Adams produced a backdated invoice which purported to

20

show that Mr Azima had “SOLD” the simulator to HeavyLift on 31 October 2007 for

a “UNIT PRICE” of $1 million and that HeavyLift had “advanced” the amount of

$167,500 to Mr Azima with the result that HeavyLift owed $832,500 to Mr Azima.

None of this information was true.

96. Although none of these points are disputed by Mr Azima, he nevertheless asserts that

the invoice was not misleading. In his witness statement, Mr Azima says that there

“was nothing improper about this invoice” which “was intended to reflect the

substantial value that had been added to the simulator (which was not operational at

the time it was acquired) by HeavyLift, my wholly owned company”. It was

submitted on behalf of Mr Azima that it was legitimate for Mr Azima to produce the

invoice and book the $1 million value as this reflected the work and expertise

contributed by Mr Azima.

97. I disagree. If it was true that HeavyLift had done work which enhanced the

simulator’s value, the honest way of reflecting that increase in value would not

involve the creation of a backdated invoice purporting to record a sale of the

simulator from Mr Azima to HeavyLift that never took place.

The valuation report

98. On 3 March 2008 Mr Adams sent an email to Mr Azima stating: “I think we will get

our $1MM capital value on the DC8 sim approved by the auditors but we will need a

desktop valuation from Jeremy to confirm. Please can you arrange.” Jeremy Leggett

was an old friend of Mr Azima. Mr Azima replied a short while later copying in Mr

Leggett, the owner of Aerospace Management Capital Limited (“AMCL”) and

stating: “Dear Jeremy, In your court!”. Mr Leggett replied seven minutes later

stating: “Fine just have ray advice [sic] what he needs exactly”.

99. Two days after that initial exchange, Mr Adams emailed Mr Leggett stating, “I think

the installed and certified value should be in the $1.75MM-$2.0MM range. Need

ASAP.” Mr Leggett responded by copying in his son, Rupert Leggett, and asking

him to “go on the internet and find out something about the simulator” because “we

need to do a valuation for him and I need some story line”.

100. On 10 March 2008, Mr Adams emailed Mr Azima stressing that, “The valuation on

the sim is going to be critical for the audit and also to give us fuel with Hegde. I am

not sure he is our friend”. Mr Adams’ evidence was that the “fuel with Hegde” meant

“To give him a basis on which we booked it”.

101. On 18 March 2008, Rupert Leggett emailed Mr Adams asking “what the revenues are

like” for the simulator and adding that he hoped “to draw up something to a level

which you are satisfied with”. Mr Adams responded by providing revenue

projections which bore no relation to the revenue actually generated by the simulator.

On 19 March 2008, numerous alternative drafts of the simulator valuation were sent

to Mr Azima and Mr Adams. The final valuation stated that the “Total Asset Value”

of the simulator was $1,475,000.

102. Mr Hegde’s reaction was that the AMCL valuation was “quite unreasonable

21

considering the age (exactly 40 years old) of the simulator, its condition and

utilization in the next 6 years, Current market value of the same should not be more

than $100,000 to $150,000, provided it is in a good condition, serviceable for another

6 years. Therefore, we would like to get this simulator re-assessed by some

professional and reputable firms.”

103. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Azima that the appraisal provided by AMCL was

independent and reliable, on the basis that:

103.1 The valuation given ($1.475 million) was materially lower than the range of

values ($1.75-$2 million) that had been tentatively suggested by Mr Adams,

confirming that the valuer exercised an independent judgment.

103.2 The valuer had regard to information provided about the simulator and to

information on demand factors, including the substantial worldwide fleet of

DC-8 aircraft.

103.3 It is unremarkable for a value to be estimated through an exchange of

information between the valuer and the customer. As Mr Adams explained,

appraisals of this nature are very common in the aviation industry.

103.4 The document on its face described itself as a “desktop valuation” so RAKIA’s

protracted cross-examination to the effect that there was something

clandestine and suspicious about such an assessment was misconceived.

103.5 RAKIA has adduced no valuation evidence of its own to support a contention

that a valuation of $1 million is exaggerated or unreasonable, still less that it

was so artificial as to be a badge of fraud.

104. Mr Adams relied on the valuation as the basis for a statement to PwC that the

“simulator transferred during the year to the subsidiary in the revalued amount of

USD 1,000,000 is valid and supported by the valuation report done by an

independent assessor”.

105. In my judgment, the AMCL valuation was not independent or a reliable appraisal of

the simulator’s value. Jeremy Leggett was a friend and AMCL unquestioningly

adopted Mr Adams’ projections regarding the projected revenues and costs of the

simulator. Mr Azima and Mr Adams were extensively involved in reviewing and

proposing changes to drafts of the valuation.

Training Aids Invoices

106. In support of the entry for $450,000 in respect of “Training Aids” in the 2008

accounts, Mr Adams produced a further backdated invoice which purported to show

that Mr Azima had sold DC8 Training Aids to HeavyLift on 31 December 2007 for

that amount.

107. Mr Adams sent the draft invoice to Mr Azima, who responded with various

22

suggested changes which appear to have been intended to make the invoice look as

authentic and plausible as possible. Mr Adams made the requested changes later the

same day.

108. Mr Adams also created third party invoices which purported to show that HeavyLift

had paid $450,000 to purchase training aids from Blosser Consulting on 31

December 2007. On 24 March 2008, Mr Adams sent an email to George Blosser

stating: “Per your discussion with Farhad, here are 2 more invoices that he would like

from you in order to clarify things. Please send marked “Paid” at your earliest

convenience.”

109. Mr Azima and Mr Adams did not refer to the training aid invoices in their witness

statement. In his oral evidence Mr Azima admitted that, contrary to the terms of the

backdated invoices, neither he nor HeavyLift had made a specific payment of

$450,000 to acquire training aids from Blosser Consulting but he claimed for the first

time that training aids had been acquired as part of a larger transaction or package

and that an unidentified person had evaluated the package and come up with a

number which they inputted. When pressed on whom the alleged “package” had been

purchased from, Mr Azima said that he could not remember but shortly afterwards,

he claimed that he could now recall that the transaction was with Mr Blosser.

110. Mr Azima acknowledged that on 31 March 2008 he drafted an email to a Mr Lopez

enquiring about the possibility of purchasing training aids for the Training Academy

JV. He was unable to explain why he had done this in circumstances where (on his

case) HeavyLift had already purchased training aids from Blosser Consulting some

three months earlier.

111. Mr Adams, for his part, stated that, he knew nothing about an independent valuation of

the training aids. Instead, he said that the figure of $450,000 “came off the invoice

from George Blosser” i.e. the invoice that Mr Adams had requested Mr Blosser to

produce and approve. In the light of this, Mr Adams was forced to concede that,

insofar as HeavyLift’s audited accounts were based on the representation that the

training aids had been independently valued at $450,000, the accounts were based on

a false premise.

112. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Azima that Blosser’s allocation of $450,000 was

fair and reasonable and that RAKIA has failed to adduce any evidence to show that

the training aids did not have a value of some $450,000 so it cannot make out a case

based on the difference between cost and value.

113. I do not accept that submission. RAKIA’s case was that the accounts were

misleading in so far as they represented that HeavyLift had actually paid $450,000

for the training aids when they had not in fact done so. It was not necessary for

RAKIA to go on to establish that the value of the training aids was less than the

represented cost.

114. Following his request in the email of 24 March 2008 for a re-assessment of the value of

the simulator by a professional and reputable firm, and further details of the training

aids, to which there had been no response, Mr Hegde sent a further email as follows:

23

“In the absence of any response to my below e-mail, we believe, you

have no further clarification to our queries. This matter was referred to

our Managing Director - Dr. Khater Massaad and he was apprised of

the present condition of the Simulator. In view of the above, we do not

wish to continue our partnership in this simulator.”

The PwC audit

115. There is an issue between the parties as to whether PwC audited the Training

Academy JV as well as HeavyLift. An email dated 2 July 2015 from Ms Afsaneh

Azadeh, a longstanding close associate and senior employee of Mr Azima, records

that, according to HeavyLift’s auditor Mr Kadiri, there was no record of an audit of

the joint venture ever having been carried out. However the audit document produced

by PwC states in terms that the audit was conducted of the Training Academy JV for

the year ended 31 December 2008, as well as of HeavyLift. I proceed on the basis

that there was an audit of the Training Academy JV.

116. It was contended on behalf of Mr Azima that PwC were made aware of, and were

content with, the basis on which it was alleged that the simulator and the training aids

had been supplied to the joint venture; that is, at a value that was agreed and then

reflected in invoices rather than at the value of an acquisition cost paid out to third

parties in arms’ length transactions. This was said to be obvious from the fact that the

PwC audit booked the value of the simulator and the training aids as arising from

related party transactions.

117. I do not accept this submission. The fact that PwC booked the value of the simulator

and training aids in the consolidated accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 as

arising from related party transactions does not mean that PwC was aware or agreed

that those assets would be valued on a false basis. I am not satisfied that there was any

agreement on the part of RAKIA or RAK Airways that the simulator would be valued

at $1 million. The way in which Mr Azima and Mr Adams produced invoices for the

simulator and training aids, which did not reflect the terms of an actual transaction,

and the way in which the valuation report was presented as an independent report

were not fair or reasonable, in my view.

118. The fact that Mr Azima and Mr Adams had not behaved honestly towards RAK

Airways and PwC is further confirmed by an exchange of emails concerning certain

entries in the management accounts for the Training Academy JV. Mr Adams

informed Mr Azima that paying $250,000 for generator rent and diesel was “a

reasonable compromise if all of our financial engineering on the academy is accepted

which it appears to have been”. Mr Azima replied that he had no recollection of

agreeing to this, to which Mr Adams responded: “We will agree to disagree. When

you start believing our financial engineering we are in trouble. I think you need to

change writers.”

119. In my view, RAKIA are justified in treating this exchange as an acknowledgment

that Mr Azima and Mr Adams had presented false and misleading financial

24

information about the Training Academy to RAK Airways.

Conclusion

120. I consider that the way in which Mr Adams and Mr Azima accounted for HeavyLift’s

contribution to the joint venture, including the cost of the simulator and the training

aids, in 2008 was not reasonable or honest.

(2) What was the content of the representations to RAKIA in 2013 to 2015?

121. RAKIA’s case is that, through communications sent to RAKIA between September

2013 and November 2015, Mr Azima repeatedly represented that HeavyLift had

invested a total of $2,685,000 into the Training Academy JV, which included

expenditure of approximately $1,726,000 in respect of the flight simulator as

described in the documents provided to RAKIA.

122. It was submitted for Mr Azima as follows.

122.1 The interpretation of an alleged misrepresentation will depend on the context

in which the statement is made. In IFE Fund v Goldman Sachs International

[2006] 2 CLC 1043, Toulson J held (para 50): “In determining whether there

has been an express representation, and to what effect, the court has to consider

what a reasonable person would have understood from the words used in the

context in which they were used. In determining what, if any, implied

representation has been made, the court has to perform a similar task, except

that it has to consider what a reasonable person would have inferred was being

implicitly represented by the representor's words and conduct in their context.”

122.2 The communications relied on by RAKIA set out the basis on which it was

said that HeavyLift was entitled to be compensated for the termination of the

Training Academy JV which had two aspects. The first aspect was RAK

Airways’ breaches of the Joint Venture Agreement. The second was

HeavyLift’s contributions to the joint venture which were not limited to the

particular sums outlaid but reflected the total value of the various assets

making up the training academy once installed and commissioned, including

certain costs, and were understood as such at the time.

122.3 In the particular context of this negotiation, it would make no commercial

sense for HeavyLift to limit its claim only to the amounts actually spent in

relation to the JV. A party in HeavyLift’s position would seek to be

compensated for the value it had created and of which it had been wrongfully

deprived by the other JV partner’s breach, not simply for the amounts it had

actually outlaid. This is particularly so given that RAKIA indicated that it

would be too complicated to provide HeavyLift with its half share of the land

and buildings that RAK Airways failed to contribute (Mr Buchanan’s email of

14 November 2015).

25

122.4 The May 2015 Statement of Account enclosed with Mr Azima’s email of 11

November 2015 referred to various items contributed by HeavyLift including

the simulator, training aids, and other assets under the heading “Fixed Asset

Investment”. By contrast, other parts of HeavyLift’s claim were explicitly

labelled in this document as costs: “Staff & Related Costs from US Company”.

122.5 Mr Buchanan understood the communications as referring to this concept of

“value”, not restricted to specific expenditures or costs as made clear in his

email to Mr Azima of 14 November 2015. Moreover, it was clear to RAKIA

from the communications in question that a substantial portion of the value

attributed to the simulator and the training aids arose from related party

transactions, as made clear in the HeavyLift accounts.

The backdating of the Joint Venture Agreement

123. Before considering the correspondence, it is necessary to refer to the production in

2013 by Mr Adams and Mr Azima of the backdated Joint Venture Agreement,

shortly before HeavyLift launched its compensation claim. RAKIA does not contend

that this document misstated the parties’ legal obligations (including RAKIA’s

guarantee of RAK Airways’ obligations). I infer that RAKIA has not been able to

find an original joint venture agreement. RAKIA nevertheless submits that the fact

that Mr Azima and Mr Adams created the document more than 6 years later and then

gave untrue evidence about its genesis is relevant to an assessment of their credibility

as witnesses.

124. The sequence of events was as follows:

124.1 On 23 May 2013 Mr Adams emailed Mr Azima an unsigned version of the

Joint Venture Agreement which did not contain any reference to RAKIA

having guaranteed RAK Airways’ obligations. This was followed by two

further versions emailed by Mr Adams on 27 May 2013 which likewise did

not contain any reference to a guarantee. The third version was described by

Mr Adams as the “Final clean copy” of the agreement.

124.2 On 10 June 2013, Mr Adams sent a revised (unsigned) version of the Joint

Venture Agreement to Burlingtons LLP (Mr Azima’s current solicitors)

stating that Mr Azima “will call you…to discuss”. This version of the Joint

Venture Agreement did include a sentence that RAKIA consented to and

guaranteed RAK Airways’ performance.

124.3 On 14 July 2013, Mr Adams sent an email to Mr Azima attaching the version

of the Training Academy Joint Venture Agreement which included the

RAKIA guarantee.

124.4 On 24 August 2013, Mr Azima emailed Mr Adams: “Please email me RAK

HL contract. My friend is here to……” . Dr Massaad, who by this time was

no longer employed by RAKIA, was visiting Mr Azima’s yacht in the South

26

of France at the time.

124.5 On the following day Mr Adams re-sent the email of 14 July 2013 (and

attachments) to Mr Azima.

124.6 Later that day, Mr Adams received an email from Kris Sabev, the Captain of

Mr Azima’s yacht, stating: “Dear Ray, attached is the Joint Venture

Agreement signed by both sides.” Attached to the email was a copy of the

Training Academy JVA which contained the signatures of Mr Azima and Dr

Massaad (who purportedly signed the document both on behalf of RAK

Airways and on behalf of RAKIA).

125. In cross-examination Mr Azima and Mr Adams denied retrospectively drafting,

amending and backdating the Joint Venture Agreement in 2013. Instead, they

claimed that Mr Azima was always in possession of a copy of the agreement that

was signed on 12 April 2007, and that between May and August 2013 he had been

asking Mr Adams to send him a series of drafts of the agreement so that he could

make sure that what he had was consistent with this, in order to ensure that the

signed copy he had was “the same one and there’s no others in existence”.

126. According to Mr Adams, the revisions sent in 2013 had all occurred in 2007, rather

than in 2013. He claimed that he was only in possession of “drafts” of the agreement,

and that Mr Azima had asked him to send the drafts. He was unable to explain what

conceivable purpose Mr Azima would have had in asking him to send several non-

final and superseded drafts of an agreement of which (according to both men) Mr

Azima already had a signed final version. When asked why he had described the

version sent on 27 May as the “final clean copy” but had subsequently sent Mr

Azima further amended versions of the agreement several weeks later (all of which

Mr Adams claimed had been produced in 2007) Mr Adams replied unconvincingly

that: “I was obviously in error”.

127. I consider that the explanations given by Mr Azima and Mr Adams of these

communications made no sense and were untruthful. If Mr Azima had simply asked

Mr Adams to send him “all” previous drafts of the agreement in his possession (as

Mr Adams claimed), which is inherently unlikely, they would not have been sent

over a period of nearly two months in an evolving sequence. Moreover if the drafts

were really prepared in 2007 one would also expect to see them and emails

exchanging them in 2007 in Mr Azima’s disclosure. None of these documents were

disclosed other than as attachments to emails in 2013.

128. I agree with RAKIA’s submission that the overwhelming inference from the

documentary evidence is that Mr Azima and Mr Adams retrospectively drafted the

Joint Venture Agreement in the summer of 2013. Mr Azima and Dr Massaad (who

by then had no authority to enter agreements on behalf of RAKIA) then signed that

retrospectively drafted and backdated document on board Mr Azima’s yacht on 25

August 2013 and thereafter misrepresented to RAKIA that this document was the

original document that had been signed on 12 April 2007.

The correspondence

27

129. The relevant correspondence concerning HeavyLift’s claim for compensation is as

follows:

129.1 On 2 September 2013, Mr Adams sent a letter to RAKIA’s then chief

executive, Jim Stewart, claiming that RAKIA was contractually obligated to

reimburse the substantial expenses that HeavyLift had incurred in performing

its obligations in relation to the joint venture. Mr Adams stated as follows:

"A substantial investment was undertaken by HeavyLift on behalf of the joint

venture. That investment includes, among other things:

1. Cash, training materials, and equipment of approximately $2,260,000 USD.

2. Staff and management time and related costs contributed by our US

company. [...]

… [D]ue to the failure of RAK Airways to provide its share of the joint venture

investment, the amount HeavyLift has already disbursed needs to be repaid."

129.2 Mr Stewart replied the same day explaining that he was “not familiar with the

agreement” and asking, “when the agreement was originally signed”. Mr

Adams replied by attaching a copy of what he claimed was “a copy of the 2007

Joint Venture Agreement” which had been produced and signed the previous

week.

129.3 On 2 October 2013, Mr Azima sent an email to the Ruler concerning the

Training Academy JV. The email began: “I am not sure how to bring an

unresolved business matter to your Highness as I never have before”. This

statement contradicts Mr Azima’s claim that he spoke with the Ruler about the

joint venture in 2010 and supports the Ruler’s denial that any such

conversation took place. The email made no reference to an alleged agreement

with RAK Airways regarding the value of HeavyLift’s investment in the

Training Academy joint venture.

129.4 In June 2015 Mr Azima introduced Ms Azadeh to RAKIA to present his

position on HeavyLift’s claim for compensation. On 13 June 2015, Mr

Buchanan met with Ms Azadeh and made it clear that RAKIA was willing to

investigate HeavyLift’s claim to ensure a fair outcome.

129.5 According to Mr Adams’ witness statement, following that meeting, he was

asked by Mr. Azima to provide additional information and documentation

requested by Mr. Buchanan on behalf of RAKIA to assist them with

quantifying the amount which they would be “reimbursing” HeavyLift for its

involvement in the joint venture.

129.6 By an email sent on 14 June 2015, Mr Buchanan requested detailed

information and records concerning the project including various “Financial

records, asset register and reports”. In particular, he requested amongst other

things (a) “financial records that back up the Statement of Account and show

28

all investments made by HeavyLift into or on behalf of the JV, including date,

account details etc”; and (b) “details of the assets owned or held/used by the

Training Academy JV to the extent not already forming part of the financial

data”. Mr Buchanan also asked: “More generally, what (if any) information

can you provide about RAK’s actual contribution [to] the joint venture in

financial terms?”.

129.7 On 6 July 2015, Ms Azadeh sent a letter from Mr Adams to Mr Buchanan

which stated that prior to the termination of the Training Academy JV

“HeavyLift had already invested $2.5 million.” The letter further stated that

while hard copies of the Training Academy JV's audited accounts for 2007

and 2008 were not available, an extract from the "Director's Report and

Balance Sheet Signature page" showed that as of 31 December 2008 the

“Total Investment by HeavyLift" in the Training Academy Joint Venture

was$2,582,881, which included a "Capital Contribution" of $1,000,000,

"Share Capital" of $40,000 plus a further investment of $1,542,881 "Due to

Related Parties ".

129.8 The letter enclosed HeavyLift’s audited accounts for 2008. The notes to the

accounts explained in relation to “Property, plant and equipment” that:

“Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated

depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment represents the

purchase cost together with any incidental expenses of acquisition”. The notes

also stated that a total of $1,282,500 attributable to the value of the simulator

and the training aids arose from related party transactions on prices agreed

between the parties.

129.9 On 9 August 2015, Mr Buchanan sent an email to Ms Azadeh which explained

that, “we need to identify relevant records, such as emails, documents and

financial information” in order to “consider your points properly”. He added

that it would be helpful “if you set out your claims against RAK Airways in

greater detail and provided evidence to support those claims”.

129.10 On 9 October 2015, Mr Azima sent an email to Mr Buchanan (copied to Ms

Azadeh) regarding HeavyLift’s claim. In that email he stated, “Our costs were

$2.6MM which we have documented for RAK more than once”.

129.11 On 21 and 27 October 2015, Mr Buchanan sent further emails to Ms Azadeh

in which he explained that he was compiling various “questions” regarding

HeavyLift’s contribution to the Training Academy JV which were intended to

identify “what may be due” and to “assess the value of amounts owing, if any”

to HeavyLift arising from the termination of the Training Academy JV.

129.12 On 29 October 2015, Mr Buchanan sent an email to Mr Azima which

contained a timeline of events concerning the Training Academy JV and

referred to Mr Azima’s previous statements that HeavyLift was entitled to

approximately $2.5m. Mr Buchanan asked Mr Azima to identify the basis of

the claims with reference to the Joint Venture Agreement, including details of

the particular provisions of the Joint Venture Agreement which were said to

29

have been breached and the losses caused by those breaches.

129.13 On 10 November 2015, Mr Buchanan emailed Mr Azima seeking clarification

of “the basis on which you calculate the compensation due to you”. He added:

“It might be easier for me to work on a compensation package if I had details

of the monies actually spent by HeavyLift Airline on the training academy

project. This would need to be evidenced so that our lawyers/ internal audit

could look at it (apologies for that - you know what lawyers are like!). If that

is not too inconvenient perhaps you could let me know.”

129.14 On the same day (10 November 2015), Mr Azima forwarded to Mr Buchanan

an email from Mr Adams attaching a number of documents referring to an

investment of $2,260,000 by HeavyLift under the Joint Venture Agreement

and attaching various documents purportedly evidencing that investment

including a statement of account dated 31 May 2015 to the effect that

HeavyLift had made a total fixed asset investment of $2,260,000 of which

$1,726,000 had been paid in respect of "Simulator (including installation &

certification)", training aids in the sum of $450,000 and a further investment

of $425,000 in the form of "Staff & Related Costs from US Company".

129.15 On 11 November 2015, Mr Azima sent an email to Mr Buchanan which

contained several references to the amount of money that HeavyLift had

invested in the Training Academy JV. The email stated: “Total Loss per

Statement of Account = $2,260,000 + $425,000 = $2,685,000”. A number of

documents were attached to the email purportedly supporting these figures.

129.16 On 14 November 2015, Mr Buchanan emailed Mr Azima again in the

following terms, stating that he had reviewed Mr Adams’ email and was

authorised to verify the various valuations referred to in the email. “My team

is working on this as a matter of priority, but it would help me greatly if you

could confirm what you believe to be the $ value of HLI's claim. This will

ensure I am targeting the right number In relation to valuations, and given

your extensive experience in the aviation sector, I would be grateful for your

thoughts on the current value of the simulator. I understand this was the largest

single asset that HLI contributed to the training academy. Is there a market for

these simulators? If so, we would like to enlist your help in finding a suitable

buyer.”

129.17 Mr Buchanan went on to address the claim for compensation for loss of the

Academy building. He noted that he was having difficulty justifying this claim

internally, adding that any failure to contribute the land was the basis for

considering compensation to HeavyLift for the amounts it contributed to the

joint venture, including the additional management time cost/expense noted in

Mr Adams’ email but that including the building would introduce additional

complexity and delay and there was no material to support the $5 million

value attributed to the building by Mr Adams.

129.18 Mr Azima replied the same day expressing his disappointment at Mr

30

Buchanan's email. Later that day Mr Buchanan replied by email explaining

that his objective was to seek a settlement of this matter after reviewing the

legal and moral position and then quantifying the claim:

“I am sure you appreciate that I need to be able to formally justify

the value which you place on your claims? It will assist me greatly

if you can place a $ value on your claim, let me know how you

arrive at your figure and provide the evidence and justification for

it. I need your estimate of loss - what you have suffered. Without

this how can I know I am targeting the right number? This should

not be a time consuming process. I am looking to progress the

matter in a timely manner and in the spirit we discussed but will

need your help.”

129.19 On 15 November 2015 Mr Azima sent an email stating as follows:

“I couldn't help but laugh when I read your last sentence! Timely matter!

You set the deadline in September. 53 days later the optimism lives on! I

have stated clearly, this is not a legal issue to be disputed, facts are sitting

at RAK airport. The claim in 2 parts, first is based on what has been spend

to create the training academy. Second the unfulfilled commitment of

RAK. First part is clear, you have the records. The Building, it is there....

We can talk about it.”

129.20 On the same date, Mr Adams sent an email to Mr Buchanan which stated that

the clam was in two parts, as follows:

“1. Part 1 of the claim is for 50% of the value of the land and building at

the airport. We have estimated the value because we do not know the

cost or the current market value.

2. Part 2 is for our net investment in the assets of the Academy due to

the failed performance on the part of RAK Airways. We have not added

on any intangibles such as loss of profit. We have previously provided

documentation for this portion of the claim totalling USD $2,685,000.”

Conclusion

130. The central issue is whether the communications sent to RAKIA in the period 2013

to 2015 concerning HeavyLift’s claim for compensation are to be construed as

representations as to the amounts actually expended by HeavyLift or whether they

should be construed more loosely as referring to valuations of HeavyLift’s

contribution to the joint venture.

131. I have come to the conclusion that the communications did amount to a

representation that HeavyLift had actually spent a total of $2.685 million in making

its contribution to the Training Academy, including expenditure of approximately

$1.726 million in respect of the flight simulator.

31

132. This is for the following reasons:

132.1 The communications from Mr Azima, Ms Azadeh and Mr Adams

consistently refer to investments by HeavyLift in the sense of money

actually spent by HeavyLift. For example:

(a) The first letter in the sequence dated 2 September 2013 stated that

HeavyLift was seeking to be compensated for its “investment”

including $2,260,000 on cash training materials and equipment. The

ordinary meaning of “investment” in an asset is the spending of

money to purchase the asset. This construction is reinforced by the

later reference to the need to repay the amount “disbursed” by

HeavyLift.

(b) Similarly the letter dated 6 July 2015 from Ms Asadeh refers to an

“investment” by HeavyLift of $2.5 million in the Training Academy.

The enclosed audited accounts for 2008 stated that the property, plant

and equipment were stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The

explanation in the notes about related party transactions made clear

that the prices were agreed. It did not suggest that the prices had not

been paid.

(c) Mr Azima’s email of 9 October 2015 referring to “our costs of $2.6

million” is a clear representation that the sum of $2.6 million had been

spent by HeavyLift.

(d) Mr Azima’s email of 15 November 2015 referring to the claim in

respect of the amounts “spent” on the Training Academy JV.

(e) Mr Adams’ email of the same date referring to HeavyLift’s “net

investment” in the assets of the Training Academy JV “totalling USD

$2,685,000.”

132.2 The fact that the May 2015 Statement of Account enclosed with Mr Azima’s

email of 11 November 2015 referred to various items contributed by

HeavyLift including the simulator, training aids, and other assets under the

heading “Fixed Asset Investment”, in contrast to another head of claim being

“Staff & Related Costs from US Company” does not assist Mr Azima. The

reference to “costs” does not displace the ordinary meaning of “investment”.

132.3 Mr Buchanan’s emails read as a whole make clear that RAKIA was

interested in determining the amount actually spent by HeavyLift, for

example his email of 10 November 2015 in which he asked for details of the

“monies actually spent”. The references by Mr Buchanan to “value” or

“valuation” do not affect this conclusion. Whilst a claim for compensation

could have been advanced on the basis of value, that was not how the claim

was in fact advanced or how it was requested.

132.4 The fact that the compensation claim was advanced on two fronts (by

32

reference to compensation for wrongful termination as well as in respect of

HeavyLift’s outlay or investment) did not entitle HeavyLift to misstate the

amount of its investment or to displace the clear meaning of the statements as

to the amount invested.

133. In short, the relevant statements expressly referred to the amount of HeavyLift’s

“investment”, “substantial investment”, “total investment” and “net investment” in

terms that were clearly a representation about the total costs that HeavyLift had

incurred through its contribution to the Training Academy JV, not the value of its

contribution.

(3) Which party made the representations?

134. RAKIA’s case is that the HeavyLift Investment Representation was made by Mr

Azima (and individuals acting on his behalf). Although only one of the

communications pleaded by RAKIA was actually sent by Mr Azima (namely, the

email dated 10 November 2015 referred to at paragraph 129.14 above) RAKIA

contends that the pleaded communications collectively constituted a single

representation made by Mr Azima. In support of this case, RAKIA contends as

follows:

134.1 Mr Adams and Ms Azadeh are longstanding close associates of Mr Azima

who were clearly acting on his behalf at the relevant time. In particular Mr

Adams confirms in his witness statement that following the meeting on 13

June 2015, “I was asked by Mr Azima to provide additional information and

documents requested by Mr Buchanan” and that he subsequently did so “[i]n

accordance with this request.”

134.2 During the course of the exchanges summarised above, Ms Azadeh and Mr

Adams sent emails from their personal and/or Aviation Leasing Group email

addresses, rather than from HeavyLift email addresses.

134.3 The communications were made in the course of settlement negotiations with

RAKIA that were intended to, and which did in fact, result in the conclusion

of a Settlement Agreement expressly recording that HeavyLift’s claim was

advanced “through Mr Azima”, which resolved “all claims which Mr Azima”

may have against RAKIA or any other RAK Entity, contained an express

warranty and representation concerning Mr Azima’s conduct towards RAKIA

and which was signed by Mr Azima both on behalf of HeavyLift and on his

own behalf as a party.

135. In response, Mr Azima contends as follows:

135.1 RAKIA’s case that the communications were sent “on behalf of” Mr Azima is

at odds with the content of the communications themselves which indicate that

they were sent on behalf of HeavyLift. All the communications (including the

one sent by Mr Azima) concern a claim by HeavyLift not Mr Azima. The claim

relates to a joint venture to which HeavyLift (and not Mr Azima) was a party

and the Settlement Agreement entailed a payment by RAKIA which was

33

described by the Settlement Agreement as being a payment to HeavyLift (not

to Mr Azima).

135.2 The communications which initiated the claim were not sent by Mr Azima and

were explicitly made on behalf of HeavyLift, not Mr Azima:

(a) The first communication is a September 2013 letter on HeavyLift

letterhead, signed by Mr Adams in his capacity as the CFO of

HeavyLift over his HeavyLift email address. It refers to HeavyLift’s

investment and HeavyLift’s conduct during the Joint Venture. That

letter also makes clear that the claim was being made in light of the

need to wind up HeavyLift’s affairs.

(b) The second communication is, again, a letter of July 2015 on HeavyLift

letterhead (emailed by Ms Azadeh), signed again by Mr Adams as the

former CFO of HeavyLift, describing HeavyLift’s investments.

(c) The remaining communications then continued in the same vein.

135.3 Whether Mr Adams and Ms Azadeh were associates of Mr Azima is beside the

point. Their communications were on their face sent by and for HeavyLift, for

which both those individuals worked.

135.4 Reference to the range of corporate and personal email addresses used does not

establish that either individual was acting for Mr Azima. Moreover, Mr Adams

also used his HeavyLift email address in the first communication, and his title

as HeavyLift’s CFO in both of the letters he sent.

135.5 The identity of the parties to the ultimate Settlement Agreement does not bear

on the identity of the party on whose behalf the communications were sent.

HeavyLift was in any event also a party to the Settlement Agreement.

135.6 Mr Buchanan, with whom the negotiations were conducted, rightly

characterised the representations made to him as being by and on behalf of

HeavyLift, not Mr Azima.

136. In my judgment, Mr Azima’s contention that the HeavyLift Investment

Representation was made by HeavyLift and not by him personally is artificial and

lacking in substance.

136.1 It is clear that Mr Azima was the driving force behind the claim for

compensation. The communications made by Mr Adams and Ms Azadeh were

made with his knowledge, authorisation and approval.

136.2 The Settlement Agreement itself records that the claim that RAK Airways was

liable to pay compensation was advanced “through Mr Azima”, thereby

underscoring Mr Azima’s responsibility for the communications made in

connection with the compensation claim and reflecting his role as its proponent.

34

The original draft of the Settlement Agreement did not even include HeavyLift

as a party since, as Mr Buchanan explained in his evidence, HeavyLift no longer

existed, having been struck off the register of Sharjah free zone companies in

April 2013.

136.3 Mr Azima’s evidence was that HeavyLift ceased operations in 2011 and it was

an uncontested fact that HeavyLift was struck off the register of Sharjah free

zone companies in April 2013. In a later email dated 29 October 2015, Mr

Adams was asked what effect, if any, HeavyLift being non-operational had on

the claim. Mr Adams’ replied on 5 November 2015 that Mr Azima was

entitled to claim compensation under clause 6 of the Joint Venture Agreement

on the basis that he was a shareholder, successor or assignee of HeavyLift.

This answer is inconsistent with Mr Azima’s case that the representation was

made by HeavyLift, rather than him.

136.4 Mr Azima had been the sole shareholder of HeavyLift. During his oral evidence

Mr Azima emphasised that he and HeavyLift were effectively synonymous for

the purposes of dealings with the Training Academy JV, (“It’s said by

HeavyLift, but I am HeavyLift”).

137. I conclude that the HeavyLift Investment Representation was made on behalf of Mr

Azima.

(4) Was the HeavyLift Investment Representation false?

138. RAKIA’s case is that, contrary to Mr Azima’s representations to RAKIA in 2015 that

the simulator had cost HeavyLift upwards of $1 million, HeavyLift in fact acquired

the flight simulator in 2006 for just $167,500 as evidenced by the signed sale

agreement with MK Airlines dated 7 August 2006 and the email from

amir@HeavyLift.com to Mr Azima dated 10 June 2007 which contained a table

stating that the “Cost of DC8 Simulator (MK Airlines)” was “[$]167,500”.

139. Mr Azima contends that it would then be necessary for RAKIA also to prove that the

out of pocket costs actually incurred by HeavyLift on the simulator and training aids

were less than represented.

140. I disagree. The communications regarding the simulator were clearly referring to the

cost of the simulator itself, rather than the costs of the simulator plus ancillary

services or equipment. In any event, the costs in respect of equipment and services

provided in connection with the installation of the flight simulator fail to support a

claim that the costs of acquiring and installing the simulator were more than $1.7

million. For example, according to an email sent to Mr Azima on 10 June 2007, in

addition to the “Cost of DC8 Simulator (MK Airlines)” of “$167,500.00” HeavyLift

had incurred total costs (including the cost of acquiring the simulator) in the sum of

$291,788.78. In contrast, according to HeavyLift’s preliminary accounts for the year

ended 31 December 2007, HeavyLift had spent a total of $725,959 in respect of all

simulator freight and storage charges, outside contractors, salaries and benefits, travel

and accommodation charges, legal and administrative charges (more than $185,000 of

35

which was charged by HeavyLift itself in respect of its management time), licences

and permits, simulator parts and supplies and supervision. On this basis, HeavyLift

spent a maximum of $893,459 on the simulator, about half the amount represented to

RAKIA.

141. Accordingly, even taking into account the costs of ancillary services and equipment,

the total costs incurred in relation to the installation of the flight simulator were

nowhere near the amount represented to RAKIA by Mr Azima.

142. Furthermore, it is now common ground that HeavyLift did not make a payment of

$450,000 in respect of training aids. There is in fact no evidence that HeavyLift

incurred any expenditure on this.

(5) Was Mr Azima aware that the HeavyLift Investment Representation was

false?

143. Mr Azima must have been aware that the HeavyLift Investment Representation was

false. Mr Azima had at all material times been a director of both HeavyLift and

RAK-HeavyLift Training Academy FZ-LLC. In his evidence he confirmed that

throughout the operation of the Training Academy “Mr Adams…always…sen[t] me a

copy of everything”. As a result, he knew what expenditure HeavyLift had incurred

through its investment in the Training Academy JV. Mr Azima therefore knew that

HeavyLift’s expenditure on the joint venture was nothing like the amounts represented

to RAKIA in 2015 and 2016.

144. Mr Azima knew in particular that the simulator had been purchased by HeavyLift

from MK Airlines for just $167,500 and that he had not personally paid anything

towards the cost of its acquisition. He therefore knew that the simulator had not cost$1

million to acquire and was aware that the total costs of acquiring, installing and

certifying the simulator were nowhere near $1.726 million.

145. Third, Mr Azima knew that the invoices from him in the sum of $1 million for the

simulator and $450,000 for the training aids had been backdated and did not reflect

actual purchases. It is noteworthy that none of these invoices were supplied to

RAKIA during the 2015 negotiations.

(6) Did RAKIA rely on the HeavyLift Investment Representation?

146. In order to succeed with its claim for misrepresentation, RAKIA must establish that it

relied on the relevant representation.

147. RAKIA’s case on reliance is as follows:

147.1 It agreed to pay $2.6 million to HeavyLift on the basis that RAKIA had an

obligation to compensate Mr Azima and HeavyLift for the amount of money

they had spent in contributing to the Training Academy JV.

36

147.2 As a result of the representations made by and on behalf of Mr Azima, Mr

Buchanan believed HeavyLift’s financial statements to be true and that it had

spent a total of approximately $2.6 million on its contribution to the Training

Academy JV. As a result, he formed the view that RAKIA should enter the

Settlement Agreement and pay the settlement sum in that amount. Mr

Buchanan confirms that, “in making the payment to HeavyLift, RAKIA was

seeking to compensate HeavyLift for the amount RAKIA understood had

actually been spent on the Training Academy JV”.

147.3 RAKIA’s reliance on the truth of the information provided by Mr Azima

regarding the amount of HeavyLift’s investment in the Training Academy JV

was also reflected in the contemporaneous correspondence. For example:

(a) In an email to Ms Azadeh dated 14 June 2015, Mr Buchanan explained

that, “our understanding of the arrangements for the RAK- HeavyLift

Training Academy is limited to information provided by you during

yesterday’s meeting, including a letter dated 2 September 2013 from Ray

Adams to Jim Stewart. None of those involved in the original

arrangements remain in RAK, and some of the RAK companies that

appear to have been involved have been restructured”.

(b) On 9 August 2015, Mr Buchanan sent an email to Ms Azadeh which

explained that there were significant “difficulties in identifying and

assessing information that might enable us to respond properly to the

issues you have raised”. Given the difficulty in locating relevant records,

Mr Buchanan therefore requested Ms Azadeh to “set out your claims

against RAK Airways in greater detail and provide evidence to support

those claims”.

147.4 Mr Azima’s assertions that the inducement requirement is not made out

because RAKIA entered into the Settlement Agreement “for purposes

unconnected to the settlement of the claim” and because it had reached an

“internal evaluation…that Mr Azima was acting against RAKIA, and

fraudulently” is incorrect.

147.5 If a misrepresentation is of such a nature that it would be likely to play a part

in the decision of a reasonable person to enter into a transaction it will be

presumed that it did so unless the representor satisfies the court to the contrary;

Dadourian v Simms [2009] EWCA Civ 169.

148. Mr Azima denies that RAKIA has established reliance. He submits as follows:

148.1 The evidence at trial established that the decision to enter the Settlement

Agreement was taken by the Ruler, not by Mr Buchanan or the board of RAK

Dev or the board of RAKIA. Mr Buchanan’s evidence established that his

function was to make a “recommendation” and the actual power to decide

rested with the Ruler. His oral evidence confirmed clearly that entry into the

Settlement Agreement was the Ruler’s personal decision:

37

“Q. And it's right, isn't it, that the decision to enter into the settlement

agreement was taken on behalf of RAKIA by the Ruler? A. That is correct.

Q. It wasn't taken by you, was it? A. That is correct.”

148.2 Mr Gerrard’s evidence was similarly that the Ruler was the “ultimate authority

in RAK” and “if RAKIA was to undertake a course of events that he didn't

approve of” it “wouldn't necessarily happen.”

148.3 Mr Buchanan also confirmed that he did not know the Ruler’s reasons for

entering into the Settlement Agreement:

“Q. Thank you. You are not in a position, are you, Mr Buchanan, to give

evidence as to what the Ruler may have -- what may have influenced the Ruler

into entering into the settlement agreement in March 2016? A. No, I'm not.”

148.4 There is no evidence that the Ruler had regard to or relied on the alleged

representation by Mr Azima as to the contribution made by HeavyLift into the

Training Academy. Nor does the Ruler suggest that he relied on Mr

Buchanan’s consideration of that alleged representation.

148.5 There is no evidence that the Ruler placed any reliance on the alleged

representation that HeavyLift had spent certain amounts on the joint venture.

There is no reference to this in the Ruler’s witness statement and the letter

seeking the Ruler’s approval also makes no reference to the alleged

representations by Mr Azima as to the amount of HeavyLift’s investment in

the joint venture.

148.6 Neither RAK Development nor RAKIA itself approved entry into the

Settlement Agreement through a decision of the board of either company.

148.7 RAKIA entered the Settlement Agreement for ulterior motives and in bad faith

in order to use it to keep Mr Azima onside in its negotiations with Dr Massaad.

Conclusion on reliance

149. In order for RAKIA to succeed with its claim for damages for misrepresentation, it

must establish a causal link between the representation and the decision to enter the

Settlement Agreement. It is not necessary to prove that the misrepresentation was the

sole or even predominant cause of the decision to enter the contract but it is necessary

to show that misrepresentation contributed to the decision to contract; Edgington v

Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch D.

150. The evidence establishes that Mr Buchanan relied on the HeavyLift Investment

Representation in deciding that RAKIA should enter the Settlement Agreement. The

payment of $2.6 million to resolve all claims which Mr Azima or HeavyLift may have

against it or any other RAK entity was calculated by him as the amount of HeavyLift's

total investment in the Training Academy JV, as represented by Mr Azima. Mr

Buchanan was unable independently to verify what, if anything, was properly owing

to Mr Azima, “The fact that Mr Azima was willing to stand behind the figures on

38

which he was basing the claim was reassuring”. As a result, Mr Buchanan “believed

this payment [of $2.6 million] would fully reimburse HeavyLift and Mr Azima for

the amount they had put into the Training Academy JV”.

151. Mr Buchanan then recommended to the Ruler that RAKIA should enter the

Settlement Agreement. It is a reasonable inference, in my judgment, that in deciding

to enter the Settlement Agreement the Ruler was acting on the basis of Mr Buchanan’s

recommendation. The fact that, as stated in his witness statement, the Ruler wished

to enter the Settlement Agreement in order to settle the claims brought by Mr Azima

and to obtain assurance from him that he had acted in good faith towards RAKIA and

RAK does not mean that he was not also acting on the basis of the recommendation.

152. The fact that the Ruler was not personally aware of the HeavyLift Investment

Representation does not negate the reliance placed on the representations by RAKIA

via Mr Buchanan. If a misrepresentation is made to an agent who relies on it to make

a recommendation to the decision-making principal but does not pass the

representation on, the principal will nevertheless be entitled to relief for

misrepresentation; see Chitty on Contracts 33rd Edition, paragraph 7-032; Brown v

InnovatorOne Plc [2012] EWHC 1321 at paragraph 885; OMV Petrom v Glencore

International AG [2015] EWHC 666 at paragraph 139.

153. For reasons set out below in relation to the hacking claim, I was not persuaded that

RAKIA entered into the Settlement Agreement for ulterior motives, negating reliance

on the HeavyLift Investment Representation.

154. In short, the evidence establishes that RAKIA did rely on the HeavyLift Investment

Representation.

(7) Loss

155. Mr Azima contends that, to the extent that RAKIA’s contention of a

misrepresentation is upheld, the damages to which it is entitled should be limited to

the difference between the costs that the Court finds HeavyLift did incur, and the

level of costs that the Court finds were represented as having been incurred.

156. The victim of a fraudulent misrepresentation is entitled to be put in the position it

would have been in had the misrepresentation not been made (Doyle v Olby

(Ironmongers) Limited [1969] 2 QB 158). On this footing, I consider that RAKIA would

be entitled to total damages of $2.6 million. This is on the basis that, had Mr Azima not

fraudulently misrepresented the total cost of HeavyLift’s investment in the Training

Academy JV then RAKIA would not have entered into the Settlement Agreement

and paid the sum of $2.6 million to Mr Azima in the erroneous belief that this

equated to the costs actually incurred by HeavyLift in making that investment. Even

assuming in Mr Azima’s favour that damages should be calculated on the different

basis he contends for, Mr Azima failed to establish what the actual incurred costs

were. However, in its closing submissions RAKIA limited its damages claim to what

it says it would have been prepared to pay, had the true position with regard to

HeavyLift’s expenditure been explained and that it would therefore give credit for the

39

sums of $700,000 and $167,000 in respect of that expenditure. On the basis of this

concession, the damages payable are $1,733,000 ($2.6 million less $867,000).

Conclusion on the HeavyLift Misrepresentation Claim

157. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Azima that RAKIA had failed to adduce cogent

evidence commensurate with the seriousness of the allegation of fraudulent

misrepresentation and that, in seeking to prove its case, RAKIA should not be

permitted to take advantage of deficiencies in documentation as it failed to ensure

that the joint venture’s records, which were left at the premises of RAK after the

termination of the joint venture, were properly maintained.

158. I am satisfied that the evidence relied on by RAKIA in support of its fraud claim is

sufficiently cogent and that RAKIA did not take unfair advantage of a failure to

maintain the joint venture’s records (assuming in Mr Azima’s favour that RAKIA

was under a duty to so) in advancing the claim.

159. I therefore conclude that Mr Azima is liable to RAKIA in the sum of $1,733,000 by

way of damages for fraudulent misrepresentation in respect of the HeavyLift

Investment Misrepresentation.

The Good Faith Misrepresentation Claim

160. RAKIA submitted as follows.

160.1 By agreeing to Clause 3.2 of the Settlement Agreement Mr Azima represented

to RAKIA, in order to induce it to enter into the Settlement Agreement, that

he had at all times acted in good faith and with the utmost professional

integrity in his dealings with RAKIA or other RAK Entities (“the Good Faith

Representation”);

160.2 In entering into the Settlement Agreement, and in paying the settlement sum

of $2.6 million to HeavyLift, RAKIA expressly relied upon the Good Faith

Representation;

160.3 In fact, by reason of Mr Azima’s wrongful conduct, the Good Faith

Representation was false;

160.4 The Good Faith Representation was made by Mr Azima knowing that it was

false;

160.5 As a result of Mr Azima's fraudulent misrepresentation, RAKIA has suffered

loss.

161. Mr Azima’s response is, in summary, as follows.

161.1 Clause 3.2 of the Settlement Agreement does not constitute a representation;

40

161.2 The allegations of wrongdoing are denied;

161.3 Mr Azima’s conduct was not contrary to the Good Faith Representation;

161.4 RAKIA did not rely on the Good Faith Representation and so did not suffer

loss.

162. The Good Faith Misrepresentation Claim therefore gives rise to the following main

issues:

162.1 Does Clause 3.2 of the Settlement Agreement constitute a representation?

162.2 Are the allegations of wrongdoing established?

162.3 Was the alleged wrongdoing contrary to the Good Faith Representation?

162.4 Did RAKIA rely on the Good Faith Representation?

(1) Does Clause 3.2 of the Settlement Agreement constitute a representation?

163. Mr Azima denies that Clause 3.2 is a representation. In particular, he contends that:

163.1 Clause 3.2 of the Settlement Agreement “does not use the words

“representation”, “represents” etc, which would have been used if it had been

intended to constitute a representation”.

163.2 Clause 3.2 “purports to apply to Mr Azima’s and HeavyLift’s future actions,

yet a person cannot validly or sensibly make a non-contractual representation

about matters which have not yet occurred”.

164. I reject this submission. There is no requirement for a factual statement to expressly

utilise the terminology of “representation”, “represents” etc. in order to constitute a

representation for the purposes of the law of misrepresentation. Clause 3.2 of the

Settlement Agreement stated that Mr Azima “expressly…warrants and confirms” and

that the payment to HeavyLift was made “in reliance on this express warranty and

confirmation”.

165. I accept RAKIA’s submission that the addition of the words “and confirms” and “and

confirmation” after “warrants” and “warranty” makes it clear that in addition to

providing a contractual warranty, Mr Azima was also making a representation of fact

regarding his past conduct and his current intention with respect to his future

conduct. The existence of a representation is also demonstrated by the statement that

the payment to HeavyLift “is made in reliance on” the “warranty and confirmation”.

If there were only a warranty and no representation, then the words “made in reliance

on” would make no sense since “reliance” is relevant only to tortious, rather than

contractual, liability. The reference to “reliance” suggests that that Mr Azima had

made a representation as well as a contractual warranty.

41

(2) Has RAKIA proved the alleged wrongful conduct of Mr Azima?

166. The wrongful conduct alleged by RAKIA is that Mr Azima:

166.1 falsely claimed to have introduced the buyers of the Hotel to RAKIA;

166.2 fraudulently procured RAKIA to pay the sum of $1,562,500 in purported

consideration for non-existent referral services by Mr Azima in connection

with the sale of the Hotel, and fraudulently created a sham Referral Agreement

intended to conceal that misappropriation and the payment of a bribe of half

a million dollars to Dr Massaad, in connection with the sale of the Hotel;

166.3 entered into a dishonest secret commission arrangement, which would have

enabled Mr Azima to obtain an interest in the Hotel worth more than $6

million in exchange for a nominal payment of ten dollars;

166.4 played a central role in a planned media campaign aimed at maliciously

denigrating the Ruler and other entities and persons in RAK;

166.5 made and/or failed to correct various fraudulent misrepresentations in the

course of negotiations concerning the Proposed ISR JV, which were designed

to enable Mr Azima and his associates to misappropriate approximately $20m

from RAKIA;

166.6 made fraudulent misrepresentations regarding the total costs that HeavyLift

had incurred through its contribution to the Training Academy JV, which were

designed to induce RAKIA to pay a far larger amount in respect of those costs

than HeavyLift had actually incurred.

167. I have already addressed the sixth allegation. The remaining five allegations are

addressed in turn below.

(a) Did Mr Azima falsely represent to RAKIA that he had introduced the

prospective purchasers of the Hotel to RAKIA?

168. Mr Azima’s account in his witness statement of how he came to introduce the

Potential Buyers to the Hotel transaction was as follows:

“79. In or around 2010, after Sheikh Saud became ruler of RAK, Dr Massaad

told me that the Sheikh was under pressure to liquidate foreign assets and

to invest in RAK to improve RAK's economic situation. This was later

confirmed to me by Sheikh Saud himself at a subsequent meeting. Dr

Massaad asked if I could assist with the sale of a number of overseas assets

owned by RAK, including the Sheraton Metachi Palace Hotel in Tbilisi

("the Hotel") and the Poti Free Zone. I understood this to be the

implementation of the Sheikh's wishes.

80. I was told the minimum price that would be accepted for the Hotel

($50,000,000) and asked to introduce potential buyers. Dr Massaad said I

42

would receive a 5% commission from the gross sale price plus 50% of any

amount in excess of US $50,000,000.

81. 1 had previously met with three individuals (Houshang Hosseinpour,

Pourya Nayebi and Amir Farsoodeh) in Istanbul, Turkey in around August

2011 to discuss the possibility of helping them to establish an airline in

Georgia. They had approached me to assist in this regard because of my

expertise and reputation in the airline industry. However, this venture did

not ultimately proceed because terms could not be agreed.

82. Mr Hosseinpour subsequently contacted me in September 2011 and asked

if HeavyLift was for sale. It was around this time that he also introduced

me to Houshang Farsoodeh, Amir Farsoodeh's brother. Ultimately, Mr

Hosseinpour signed a contract to purchase a portion of RAK Trans

Holding FZ LLZ's shares in HeavyLift. However, he defaulted on the share

sale agreement and the shares were therefore not transferred.

83. After I was asked to help find buyers for the Hotel, I thought of Mr

Hosseinpour, Houshang Farsoodeh and Mr Nayebi ("the Potential

Buyers") as candidates. I met with Houshang Farsoodeh and Mr

Hosseinpour in Dubai (I met with Mr Nayebi later on as he lived in

Georgia). I suggested that they consider buying the Hotel as it would allow

natural vertical integration with their intended airline business. They

confirmed to me that they were interested. We had several follow-up

meetings to discuss various aspects of the sale.

84. I subsequently introduced Mr. Hosseinpour and Houshang Farsoodeh to

Dr Massaad in RAK. I then accompanied them on a trip to Tbilisi, Georgia

to show them the Hotel and introduce them to various people there,

including Gela `ZaZa' Mikadze, the CEO of Ras Al Khaimah Investment

Authority Georgia LLC ("RAKIA Georgia"), the company through which

RAKIA owned the Hotel. Mr Mikadze showed us the Hotel and provided

the Potential Buyers with financial information in relation to it. Mr

Hosseinpour, Houshang Farsoodeh and I stayed at the Hotel for two or

three days. Mr Nayebi had a home of his own in Georgia, where he stayed

during our trip.

85. After the trip to Georgia, I returned to Dubai with the Potential Buyers. I

then went to RAK and met with Dr Massaad. I told Dr Massaad that the

Potential Buyers were interested and that I thought that we could move

forward with the transaction. He asked me to proceed and said the Sheikh

wanted to complete the sale quickly. We also discussed my commission.

Dr Massaad said that he would discuss this with the Sheikh and would

have his lawyers send me a written agreement.

86. Dr Massaad suggested that we meet the Potential Buyers the following day

for lunch. Accordingly, Mr Hosseinpour and Mr Farsoodeh came to RAK

the next day.

43

87. We discussed the final details of the sale over lunch and reached a tentative

agreement. Dr Massaad then suggested that I take Mr Hosseinpour and

Houshang Farsoodeh to see the Sheikh that afternoon at the palace. I then

called the Sheikh and he invited us for tea that afternoon. I accompanied

Mr Hosseinpour and Houshang Farsoodeh to the palace, where the Sheikh

received us warmly and we discussed the proposed terms of the

transaction. Sheikh Saud was pleased with the proposed terms of the sale,

and he encouraged the parties to move forward with a speedy purchase

process. We also discussed other possible transactions, including the sale

of the Poti Free Zone. The Sheikh thanked me for my role.”

169. Mr Azima exhibited photographs taken of a meeting in Istanbul, the metadata for

which indicates that four of them were taken on 26 August 2011, and one of them

on 28 August 2011.

170. Mr Azima relied on a number of contemporaneous documents which it was submitted

supported his case that he had referred the Potential Buyers to RAKIA, in particular

the following:

170.1 An email on 2 October 2011 showed that a meeting was convened between

Mr Azima (accompanied by a Mr Mahallati) on 3 October 2011 with two of

the Potential Buyers. Mr Mahallati then wrote to the third of the Potential

Buyers, Mr Nayebi, to report on the meeting between him, Mr Azima and the

“two Hs” (which was a reference to the other Potential Buyers, namely

Houshang Hosseinpur and Houshang Farsoodeh): “Just wanted to confirm

we had a great meeting with the two H's. Based on what we agreed we are

moving forward.”

170.2 Emails showing that in the days before the Memorandum of Understanding

(the “MOU”) was signed (which appears to have taken place on 10 October

2011), Mr Azima obtained passenger information from the Potential Buyers

and provided it to RAKIA which used it to create a passenger list for the

purposes of travelling with Mr Azima and Dr Massaad on one of RAKIA’s

private jets.

170.3 Emails sent after the MoU was signed in which the Potential Buyers repeatedly

wrote to Mr Azima to stress their appreciation for his work and services and

to keep him informed of their meetings regarding both the Hotel, and the

possible acquisition of an interest in the Poti free zone, owned by RAKIA

Georgia: On 19 October 2011, Mr Hosseinpour wrote as follows: “Hi dear

farhad. Ru ok? Where are you? Thanks for your management. Tonight me

and houshang with our team traveling to Tbilisi. My team will go poti port

directly from airport. for visiting. and they have meeting there with raki a

group.” On 19 October 2011, Mr Hosseinpour wrote again: “Hi dear farhad.

Pls try ur best for our team. U r a part of our life. We are like a puzzle. team

working. what is the best for us .we will do that. Take care.” On 25 November

2011, Mr Hosseinpour wrote: “We will be in Tbilisi next Thursday closing

deal 2nd dec.we push sayed also. We need more information. …You will be

for ever our big brother. You have more power. conection. experience but we

44

are business men. young. And your student.” It was submitted on Mr

Azima’s behalf that the Potential Buyers would not express their

appreciation for Mr Azima’s efforts, and describe him in these terms, unless

he had assisted in bringing the parties together and brokering the deal.

170.4 Other emails showed the Potential Buyers keeping Mr Azima informed about

their contacts with RAKIA. For example, Mr Farsoodeh shared information

with Mr Azima about the Hotel’s occupancy and room classifications received

from the Hotel’s auditors and Mr Hosseinpour emailed Mr Azima to provide

him with a copy of the cheques made out by them to RAKIA as a down-

payment. It was submitted that these communications would make little sense

unless the Potential Buyers understood Mr Azima to play an important role in

the transaction.

170.5 After the arrangement between Mr Azima and the Potential Buyers fell

through, Mr Azima emailed them on 7 December 2011 to wish them success,

and referred to the time spent in seeking to close the deal: “I am sorry that I

was not able to stay and see the finish line! For the past nearly 3 month we

lived and hoped for the day that the contract gets signed and transaction

completed.” It was submitted that this contemporaneous email confirmed that

Mr Azima had been working with the Potential Buyers on the Hotel

transaction since September 2011 which was consistent with Mr Azima’s

evidence that he was in contact with the Potential Buyers regarding the Hotel

from September 2011.

170.6 There were also communications from RAKIA’s own lawyers at the time

which it was said supported the position that Mr Azima had made the referral.

On 11 October 2011 (shortly after the MoU was signed), Mr Renwick of

Dewey & Leboeuf emailed Mr Al Sadeq of RAKIA: “I will forward to you

separate emails relating to (1) BVI counsel's fee estimate; and (ii) a draft

referral agreement in respect of the referral to RAKIA of the proposed

transaction.” And later on the same day “As referred to in my earlier email,

please find attached a very simple form of referral agreement which may be

useful as a basis for your agreement with the individual responsible for

referring the proposed transaction to RAKIA. It is a short form, generic

document and may require a little tailoring to suit your precise requirements.”

170.7 Mr Azima prepared invoices shortly after these events (in January 2012) which

referred to his role in the referral and introduction of the Potential Buyers.

These invoices spelled out the work done by Mr Azima in terms, and sought

payment of his commission. The invoices were addressed to the attention of

Mr Al Sadeq, the deputy CEO of RAKIA, and were also sent to Dr Massaad.

171. Mr Azima submitted as follows:

171.1 He and Mr Adams were integral to the deal from the very beginning. Mr

Adams drafted the MoU. He and Mr Adams took on the task of undertaking

the steps needed to complete the deal and acted as an interface between the

Potential Buyers and RAKIA and RAKIA’s lawyers, Dewey & Leboeuf; this

45

was entirely consistent with Mr Azima having made the introduction and being

involved in the deal; it was entirely inconsistent with RAKIA’s theory that Mr

Azima was some kind of interloper seeking to take credit for the deal long

after the fact.

171.2 RAKIA’s external lawyers would have a file on the transaction and the

individual lawyers would also be in a position to explain the way they

understood the transaction to have come about and the fact that RAKIA had

chosen not to call them or give any such disclosure supports the inference that

this evidence would not have supported its case.

171.3 RAKIA had offered no counter-narrative to identify the other person or means

by which the Potential Buyers were introduced to RAKIA. This is despite the

fact that other individuals on RAKIA’s side were also involved in the

transaction, beyond Dr Massaad, Mr Al Sadeq and Mr Mikadze, including

Sayed Al- Khawaja, an employee of RAKEEN Development, Georgia, and

the manager of the Hotel.

172. In support of its case that Mr Azima did not introduce the Potential Buyers, RAKIA

relied essentially on the contents of a memorandum dated 1 March 2016 drafted by

Mr Adams (“the Adams Memorandum”) which reads as follows (emphasis added).

“Dear Mr. Azima,

As you will recall, during the summer of 2011, we made a number of trips to

Poti and Tbilisi, Georgia to explore new business opportunities. We looked at

the Port in Poti, the Airport in Poti, the Free Zone in Poti, the Airport in

Tbilisi, the Tbilisi Mall, and a number of existing and prospective hotel

properties.

Among the hotel properties we reviewed was the Sheraton Metechi Palace

(SMP") in Tbilisi. We were informed that a group of businessmen from

Dubai were already negotiating the purchase of the SMP [the Hotel] and

were introduced to them. Mr. Houshang Hosseinpour, who represented the

purchasing group, offered you a minority position in the purchasing group and

indicated that an offer needed to be made quickly. I instructed our agents to

form a BVI company called Eurasia Hotel Holdings Limited for the purposes

of making such an offer and the company was organized on the 11th of October,

2011.

You, Mr. Hosseinpour, and Rd. Hater Massaad (who represented the Sellers of

the SMP) were to act as initial directors of EHHL. However, before any

activities were undertaken by the company, we determined during our due

diligence that Mr. Housseinpour, and his partners, fell below our standards for

doing business. Accordingly, we terminated our discussions with them and they

proceeded to purchase the SMP without your involvement.

During the same time, we had formed a Georgian airline and had negotiated

the purchase of an aircraft to start the airline operations. Since we had initially

46

formed EHHL, the directors were changed, and we had the company renamed

as Eurasia Aviation Holdings Limited, specifically to hold the aircraft, and the

name change was recorded on the 17th of February.”

173. RAKIA further relied on:

173.1 the absence of contemporaneous evidence supporting Mr Azima’s claim to

have introduced the prospective buyers;

173.2 the inherent improbability of Mr Azima’s account of his dealings with the

Potential Buyers, according to which the Potential Buyers went from a first

introduction to the transaction in September 2011 to signing up to the MOU

on 8 October 2011; it was more likely that the Potential Buyers had been

introduced to the purchase at an earlier stage;

173.3 the evidence of Sheikh Saud who denied that he ever told Dr Massaad or

anyone else to play any role in the sale of the Hotel or any other assets owned

by any RAK entity.

Conclusion

174. Discerning the role of Mr Azima in relation to the intended Hotel transaction is not

straightforward. There were no independent witnesses. None of RAKIA’s witnesses

was in a position to give first-hand evidence of the relevant events apart from the

Ruler, who did not attend the trial and whose evidence therefore carries limited

weight. RAKIA did not produce any contemporaneous documents relating to the

planned sale of the Hotel and the documents relied on by Mr Azima were

inconclusive. The photographs and the emails showed that that Mr Azima certainly

had meetings with the Potential Buyers and was actively involved in facilitating the

possible purchase. But they fall short of establishing that Mr Azima was

instrumental in actually introducing the Potential Buyers to the transaction. The fact

that RAKIA’s lawyers appear to have been under the impression that there was an

introduction is also inconclusive as they may have been misinformed.

175. Contrary to RAKIA’s case, the short interval between the date of the alleged

introduction and the signing of the MoU does not, in my judgment, preclude the

possibility that Mr Azima’s effected the introduction.

176. In my judgment, however, the Adams Memorandum fatally undermines Mr Azima’s

case that he introduced the Potential Buyers. The Adams Memorandum was

evidently intended to constitute a formal and accurate record of events for likely

future use by Mr Azima’s lawyers concerning Mr Azima’s involvement in the

intended sale of the Hotel. The Adams Memorandum was a short document (just

four paragraphs running to one page). It was sent to Mr Azima on 1 March 2016.

Mr Azima never requested any corrections or changes to be made to the Adams

document (as he frequently did in respect of other documents produced by Mr

Adams). Mr Adams struck me as a careful draftsman who would not have

described the circumstances of Mr Azima’s involvement with the Potential Buyers

without the instructions and approval of Mr Azima.

47

177. I do not consider that the explanations for what was, on Mr Azima’s case, a glaring

error in the Adams Memorandum, namely the time lag between the events in

question and the preparation of the memorandum and the irrelevance of the

introduction to the purpose for which the memorandum are convincing. In my view,

the memorandum is more reliable evidence than the self-serving evidence of Mr

Azima and Mr Adams. I therefore conclude that, whilst Mr Azima was involved in

the transaction and may well have had some expectation of a fee for his services, he

did not effect the introduction of the Potential Purchasers.

(b) Was the Referral Agreement a sham?

178. Mr Azima’s case concerning the Referral Agreement and the payment which he

contends was made pursuant to the Referral Agreement was, in summary, as follows:

178.1 He initially agreed with Dr Massaad to introduce buyers to the Hotel

transaction in return for a commission of 5% from the gross sale price plus

50% of any amount in excess of $50 million;

178.2 After the signing of the MoU, he received a telephone call from the US

Embassy in Georgia during which he was “advised that I should not do

business with the Potential Buyers [and] told…that the Potential Buyers were

not ‘clean’ and that they were acting as a front for undesirable elements in

Iran”.

178.3 As a result of this call, Mr Azima became concerned about the Potential

Buyers’ true intent in establishing a presence in Georgia, and the possible

contravention of US sanctions against Iran and accordingly, changed his mind

about acquiring an interest in the Hotel and declined to participate further in

the transaction.

178.4 A short while later he informed Dr Massaad and the Ruler that he felt that the

Potential Buyers had another agenda; he mentioned his concerns about the

potential contravention of US sanctions and advised them not to go ahead with

the sale.

178.5 Dr Massaad told him after that conversation that the Ruler and Dr Massaad

wanted him to step out of the purchase process and accept a 2.5% commission

instead of the 5% originally agreed, and to forego his entitlement to 50% of

the excess above $50 million.

178.6 On 25 October 2011 he received $400,000 from RAKIA. In January 2012 he

received a further $1,162,000 making a total of $1,562,000 which was 2.5%

of the purchase price of $62,500,000.

179. It was further submitted on behalf of Mr Azima as follows:

179.1 RAKIA’s case concerning the allegedly fraudulent commission agreement

48

should be dismissed in limine on the basis that RAKIA failed to challenge Mr

Azima in cross examination with regard to the assertion that the Ruler was

aware that Mr Azima was to be paid commission and approved him receiving

it.

179.2 RAKIA had also failed to put elements of its case to Mr Adams in cross-

examination, even though RAKIA’s case is that Mr Azima was a party to a

conspiracy with Mr Adams, Mr Al Sadeq and Dr Massaad to “obtain from

RAKIA substantial payments to which Mr Azima was not entitled”. Moreover,

RAKIA did not challenge Mr Adams’ evidence that the Referral Agreement

he created was, “a written version of the agreement that had already been

reached in relation to the payment of Mr Azima's commission.” His evidence

to that effect should therefore be accepted by the Court.

179.3 RAKIA’s case that the document was a sham for services that were not

actually provided cannot be reconciled with the evidence of Mr Azima’s active

role in connection with the transaction, the recognition shown to him by the

Potential Buyers, the understanding of the external lawyers that a referral had

been made and Mr Azima’s invoicing for his work at the time.

179.4 There was a clear commercial basis for the payment of a commission to Mr

Azima in that the Potential Buyers went on to conclude an agreement with

RAKIA and paid a $20 million deposit, which RAKIA retained despite failing

to transfer the Hotel to them.

179.5 Mr Azima did not seek to have Dr Massaad (or anyone else on RAKIA’s side)

sign the Referral Agreement document. It was only signed by Mr Azima. If

RAKIA’s case of conspiracy was correct, it would be expected that Dr

Massaad or Mr Al Sadeq would also have signed the document, purporting to

do so on behalf of RAKIA.

179.6 The Referral Agreement was prepared well after Mr Azima had already

received the referral fee in full (and long after RAKIA had entered into its

advantageous contract with the Potential Buyers). The document was not used

to make a claim for any payment. It therefore cannot sensibly be said that Mr

Azima created the document in order to procure payment.

179.7 The Referral Agreement included a commission of 5% which was the amount

of commission that had in fact been agreed at that stage, as reflected in the

invoice initially sent to RAKIA on 11 January 2012. The amount of the

commission was then reduced to 2.5%. However, when submitting the

document to RAKIA in August 2012, Mr Azima made no suggestion that he

was owed the difference. The intention was simply to provide a document

summarising the understanding that had been reached in October 2011.

179.8 The emailing of the document to Mr Al Sadeq at his non-work Gmail address

is not evidence of impropriety. Mr Adams had already earlier emailed a

version of the Referral Agreement (also providing for a 5% commission) to

Mr Al Sadeq at his RAKIA email address. This is inconsistent with the case

49

put by RAKIA in cross-examination that Mr Adams “wanted to make sure that

this document didn’t go into the RAKIA system until it was finalised”.

179.9 As Mr Adams and Mr Azima explained, the document was sent to Mr Al

Sadeq at his Gmail address because Mr Al Sadeq was at that time (mid-

August) on holiday in Europe and so was away from work. Other RAKIA

individuals (including Mr Buchanan and Mr Bustami) have also on occasion

used private non-RAK/RAKIA email accounts for their work, as well as RAK

email accounts at other times.

180. RAKIA contends that the Referral Agreement was a sham. In support of this case it

submits as follows:

180.1 The terms of the original Referral Agreement for which Mr Azima contends,

namely that in return for introducing potential buyers he would receive a 5%

commission from the gross sale price plus 50% of any amount in excess of US

$50,000,000, are implausibly generous, given that, on Mr Azima’s own case,

the Ruler was under pressure to liquidate foreign assets and to invest in RAK

to improve RAK’s economic situation. Had such an agreement existed, Mr

Azima would have been entitled to total commission of $9,375,000 on a sale

of the Hotel for $62,500,000.

180.2 The terms of this alleged agreement were not recorded in any written contract.

Nor were they referenced in any contemporaneous email or document or

referred to anywhere in Mr Azima’s pleaded case.

180.3 On Mr Azima’s case, he was told to forego that entitlement to more than $9.3

million, and instead to accept a payment of just $1.56 million, despite having

fully performed his side of the agreement. Mr Azima claims that he accepted

that huge reduction for the sake of his relationship with the Ruler. This case is

inherently implausible and unsupported by documentary evidence.

180.4 Mr Azima’s evidence concerning his alleged withdrawal from the sale is

internally contradictory. If (as Mr Azima claims) he had told Dr Massaad and

the Ruler that he was withdrawing from the transaction and urged them not to

proceed with the sale, then there would be no reason for Dr Massaad to

subsequently tell him to “step out of the purchase process” since by definition

Mr Azima had already “stepped out” of the transaction of his own accord and

had already informed Dr Massaad and the Ruler about this.

180.5 The contemporaneous documents show that any concern Mr Azima had

regarding possible breaches of US sanctions resulted in him attempting to

conceal the Iranian nationality of the Potential Buyers, rather than

withdrawing from the transaction. For example, the documents show that in

October and November 2011 Mr Azima helped Mr Farsoodeh apply for St

Kitts citizenship.

180.6 The documents demonstrate that Mr Azima did not withdraw from the Hotel

transaction as he claims. On the contrary, he and Mr Adams remained actively

50

involved in the transaction all the way through to (and indeed beyond) the

closing of the sale to the Potential Buyers. For example, on 8 December 2011

he signed the Share Purchase Agreement as witness for Merchant Savings and

Loan Limited, another company owned by the Potential Buyers.

180.7 On 19 November 2012, Mr Azima sent an email to Mr Stewart, RAKIA’s then

CEO, in which he stated: “I was requested to assist in sale of certain RAKIA

assets in Georgia. Including Sheraton Hotel and Poti Free Zone. However, I

was sidelined! Up on signing the SPA contract and my help “no longer was

required””. The content of this email is inconsistent with Mr Azima’s claim

that he withdrew from the transaction of his own accord well before the SPA

was signed.

180.8 The process by which the Referral Agreement was drafted was suspicious.

That process (which is not disputed) began with Mr Al Sadeq sending an

unsigned template “commission agreement” to Mr Azima on 16 November

2011. Almost eight months later on 9 July 2012, Mr Al Sadeq sent an email to

Mr Adams requesting a copy of the “master agreement for the commission

made against the Sheraton sales”. In response Mr Adams emailed an amended

version of the template to Mr Azima with various changes including a

provision for payment of a “referral fee” of 5% of the gross proceeds of sale

of the Hotel, a statement that Mr Azima had referred the Potential Buyers, a

statement that RAKIA was liable for Mr Azima’s past and future expenses in

relation to the sale of the Hotel (including first class air travel and hotel

accommodation) and for Mr Adams’ business class air travel and hotel

accommodation and a $600 daily charge.

180.9 A further amended version was produced by Mr Adams and forwarded with

attachments to Mr Al Sadeq’s private email address, stating: “as discussed,

please note the invoice and the master agreement has been modified…If it is

OK, I will send it to your RAK email. Any news on American Bank payment?”

On the same day, Mr Adams also sent an amended draft of the template to Mr

Al Sadeq’s private email address.

180.10 On 15 August 2012, Mr Azima emailed Mr Adams confirming that there

were no further changes to the draft of the Referral Agreement and stating,

“please send it”. Mr Adams replied: “To his RAK email?” A short while

later, Mr Adams sent the amended draft to Mr Al Sadeq’s private email

address stating: “Please advise if I should now send these to your RAK email

address?”

180.11 Mr Azima’s contention that the Referral Agreement was produced because

RAKIA wanted “an executed version of the agreement” which was “to record

the terms of the agreement already reached” was untenable. The Referral

Agreement did not contain any reference to Eurasia Hotel Holdings Limited

(which was the proposed buyer of the Hotel as at 25 October 2011 when the

Referral Agreement was allegedly made). The Referral Agreement referred

instead to Merchant Savings and Loan Limited as one of the parties introduced

by Mr Azima which did not become a proposed buyer until 29 November

51

2011, more than a month after the date when the Referral Agreement

purportedly came into effect.

180.12 The fact that extensive changes were made to the content of the draft Referral

Agreement between November 2011 and October 2012 is inconsistent with

Mr Azima’s claim that the Referral Agreement was merely intended to

enshrine in writing an agreement which had already been concluded by the

parties in October 2011 and which had been fully consummated by early

January 2012. For example, the Referral Agreement provided that RAKIA was

liable for Mr Adams’ expenses. In cross-examination, Mr Adams conceded

that there was no agreement in October 2011 that RAKIA would reimburse

his expenses. He also conceded that the expenses which he invoiced RAKIA

for in October 2012 pursuant to the backdated Referral Agreement were the

same as the expenses he had previously invoiced the Potential Buyers for in

December 2011.

180.13 The Referral Agreement stated that Mr Azima was entitled to commission at

the rate of 5% of the gross sale price of the Hotel. However even on Mr

Azima’s case he was never entitled to commission at this level. The alleged

initial agreement was that he would receive 5% of the sale value plus 50% of

everything over $50 million, and the later agreement was that he would receive

just 2.5% of the sale price. On his evidence, there was no “intermediate”

agreement between these two positions.

180.14 The use of Mr Al Sadeq’s private Gmail address was not adequately explained

by Mr Azima and Mr Adams. Their explanation that Mr Al Sadeq was

“travelling with his family” and they “wanted to make sure” that he received

the documents was not mentioned in any of the emails. When pressed on how

he would have known that Mr Al Sadeq was abroad, Mr Adams claimed (for

the first time) that, “I saw him on the boat…Mr Azima’s boat”. When asked

when this alleged undocumented meeting on Mr Azima’s boat occurred, he

suffered a convenient memory lapse.

180.15 Neither Mr Azima nor Mr Adams sought to explain why, nine months after

the agreement was supposedly entered into, there was suddenly such an

urgent need for an “executed” copy of that agreement to be produced that it

was necessary for them to repeatedly email Mr Al Sadeq about it during his

family holiday.

180.16 Mr Adams was also unable credibly to explain why he had sent documents

to Mr Al Sadeq’s Gmail address together with a message asking: “Please

advise if I should now send these to your RAK email address”. In particular,

it was pointed out to Mr Adams that there was no need for Mr Adams to ask

this question, since Mr Al Sadeq was clearly capable of forwarding any

documents he received at his Gmail address to his RAK email address. When

this was put to Mr Adams, he merely responded: “you can speculate however

you want”.

180.17 Mr Adams also claimed that he could not recall why he had changed draft

invoices to RAKIA by removing references to services provided for the

52

buyers instead inserting a reference to “services requested by K Massaad”.

In the circumstances, the clear inference is that Mr Adams made these

changes in order to give the deliberately false impression that the services

he was invoicing RAKIA for (and for which he had previously invoiced the

Potential Buyers) were provided at the request of Dr Massaad.

Conclusion

181. I have concluded that the Referral Agreement did not reflect a genuine agreement

with RAKIA and that it was a sham intended to conceal misappropriation of funds

by Mr Azima. I reach this conclusion for the following reasons.

181.1 I accept RAKIA’s submission that the undocumented agreement with RAKIA

alleged by Mr Azima according to which he was to be paid 5% of the gross

sale price plus 50% of any amount in excess of US $50,000,000 is implausibly

generous. I do not believe that any such agreement was entered into.

181.2 I consider that the alleged revised agreement, also undocumented, whereby

Mr Azima’s commission was to be cut by 50%, even though he had, on his

case, performed his side of the bargain, is also wholly implausible and was not

in fact entered into.

181.3 For reasons set out elsewhere in this Judgment, I believe that Mr Azima did

not effect any introduction of the Potential Buyers and that he was therefore

not entitled to any commission. The fact that Mr Azima was actively involved

in the sale process is explicable on the basis that he hoped to be rewarded by

the Potential Buyers.

181.4 Mr Azima’s case that the Referral Agreement enshrined an agreement that had

been made in October 2011 is not sustainable. For example, in cross-

examination, Mr Adams conceded that there was no agreement in October

2011 that RAKIA would reimburse his expenses. Mr Adams also conceded

that the expenses which he invoiced RAKIA for in October 2012 pursuant to

the backdated Referral Agreement were the same as the expenses he had

previously invoiced the Potential Buyers for in December 2011.

181.5 The way in which the Referral Agreement was drafted was also suspicious.

The use of Mr Al Sadeq’s private gmail address and the request for permission

to use the RAKIA email address indicates that Mr Azima and Mr Adams

wanted to conceal the Referral Agreement from RAKIA. I do not accept that

there was any plausible explanation for the use of the private gmail address.

There is no contemporaneous evidence that Mr Al Sadeq was on holiday.

Even if he was, there was no need to ask for permission to use Mr Al Sadeq’s

usual work address.

181.6 The omission on the part of RAKIA’s Counsel to challenge Mr Azima in

relation to the alleged agreement of the Ruler to the payment of commission

and to put certain elements of RAKIA’s case to Mr Adams does not require

53

me to reject that case. It was put to Mr Azima in cross examination that he was

not entitled to any commission and that the Referral Agreement was a sham.

Mr Adams had the opportunity to respond to RAKIA’s case in his witness

statement.

(c) Was the payment of $500,000 made by Mr Azima to Dr Massaad a bribe?

182. The bribery allegation forms part of RAKIA’s case that the Referral Agreement was

a sham.

183. It is common ground that on 18 January 2012 (the same day as the payment of

$1,162,500 referred to at paragraph 23 above) Mr Azima made a payment of

$500,000 to Dr Massaad. RAKIA contends that this payment was a bribe. Mr Azima

denies this. He claims the payment was for the attempted acquisition of a 25% interest

in an aircraft owned by Dr Massaad.

184. In support of its case that the payment was a bribe, RAKIA advances the following

contentions.

184.1 Contrary to Mr Azima’s claims that Dr Massaad had a 50% interest in a

Hawker 800A aircraft, the contemporaneous documents show that the Hawker

800A was wholly owned by the Ruler. None of the contemporaneous

documents contains any suggestion that Dr Massaad had any legal or

beneficial interest in the aircraft. For example:

(a) The UAE General Civil Aviation Authority Certificate of Registration

dated 25 March 2005 lists the Ruler as the owner of the aircraft and

identifies the sole operator of the aircraft as Dana Executive Jets LLC

(“Dana Jets”).

(b) A Certificate of Insurance/Reinsurance dated 14 January 2011 (which was

sent by Dr Massaad to Mr Azima on 7 March 2012) shows that the Hawker

800A aircraft was insured in favour of the Ruler, Dana Jets, RAK Airways

and the Government of RAK. The certificate contains no reference at all

to Dr Massaad.

(c) A detailed schedule of Dr Massaad’s assets attached to an email from Mr

Adams to Mr Azima dated 29 November 2013 contains no reference to

Dr Massaad owning any interest in a Hawker 800A aircraft.

184.2 Mr Azima conceded in cross-examination that he does not recall seeing

documentation showing that the Ruler was the legal owner of the aircraft, but

claims that he “would have assumed that Dr Massaad’s 50% interest was a

beneficial interest”. On Mr Azima’s own case therefore, he paid half a million

dollars for an interest in an aircraft without knowing the nature of the interest

he was acquiring and without having seen any documentary proof of the

existence of that interest.

54

184.3 Mr Azima has adduced no evidence to support his claim that, the hull value of

the Hawker 800A was approximately $2,000,000. When asked in cross-

examination whether he had taken any steps to have the alleged beneficial

interest valued before paying $500,000 to Dr Massaad for it, Mr Azima

claimed that: “I took his word for face value”. This was implausible.

184.4 There are no documents evidencing any planned or attempted transfer of an

interest in a Hawker 800A aircraft from Dr Massaad to Mr Azima. Mr Azima’s

claim that he paid the purchase price to Dr Massaad in the expectation that the

paperwork for the sale would be dealt with “later on” is both inherently

implausible and inconsistent with how Mr Azima conducted his aviation

business.

184.5 The Hawker 800A was included as a “company asset" in a “Sale of Company

Agreement” between Dana Executive Air and Captain Joachim Bergunde

under which Dana Jets was to be sold for a total price of $50 million The

“Sale of Company Agreement” was apparently signed by Dr Massaad on

behalf of Dana Executive Air on 15 December 2011 and by Capt. Bergunde

on 17 December 2011, more than a month before Mr Azima made the payment

of $500,000 to Dr Massaad. It is unlikely that Dr Massaad would have entered

an agreement with Mr Azima to sell a share in an aircraft in circumstances

where he was aware that the aircraft was likely to be sold to a third party as

part of a sale of Dana Jets.

184.6 Five days after Mr Azima paid the $500,000 to Dr Massaad, he sent an email

to Dr Massaad discussing arrangements for a lease of that aircraft. The email

did not contain any reference to Mr Azima owning a share of the aircraft as

would be expected if he had become a 25% owner less than a week earlier.

184.7 Two days later, Mr Adams emailed Mr Azima stating that: “He said he can’t

firmly commit before next week as they are selling Dana and the Hawker is

supposed to be part of the sale”. As to this:

(1) Mr Azima was unable to provide a credible explanation of why he would

be seeking to negotiate a lease in respect of an aircraft of which he had

just become a joint owner.

(2) Neither Mr Azima nor Mr Adams expressed any surprise or concern upon

learning that an aircraft of which (on their case) Mr Azima had bought a

quarter share was about to be sold to a third party.

184.8 The timing of the payment to Dr Massaad, on the same day that $1,162,500

was paid by RAKIA to Mr Azima, strongly suggests that the payment to Dr

Massaad was linked to that payment to Mr Azima, rather than an entirely

unrelated (and undocumented) aircraft transaction.

184.9 In late February 2012 Eurasia Aviation Holdings Limited (“Eurasia

Aviation”) signed an agreement to purchase a Hawker 400XP aircraft for

$1.625 million. A total of $750,000 of the purchase price was to be paid by

55

Mr Azima and Dr Massaad (who each owned 50% of the shares in Eurasia

Aviation) while the remainder was funded by way of a bank loan. According

to Mr Azima, by this date Dr Massaad was obliged to reimburse the $500,000

that Mr Azima had paid to him on 18 January 2012. In those circumstances, it

was to be expected that Dr Massaad would pay Mr Azima’s $375,000 share of

the Hawker 400XP purchase price in partial discharge of the $500,000 debt he

owed to Mr Azima. However that is not what happened. Instead, Mr Azima

and Dr Massaad each paid $375,000 in cash towards the purchase of the

Hawker 400XP. Mr Azima and Mr Adams were unable to provide a

convincing explanation for this anomaly.

184.10 Mr Azima claims that, “Soon after, on or around 30 November 2012, Dr

Massaad repaid me the $500,000”. However, the bank records show that Dr

Massaad made two payments totalling a different amount, approximately

$575,000, on 30 November and 3 December 2012.

184.11 These payments relate to a share purchase agreement (“SPA”) dated 5

November 2012 whereby Mr Azima agreed to sell a 40% shareholding in

Eurasia Aviation to Dr Massaad for total consideration of $525,000.

Accordingly, rather than reimbursing the payment made by Mr Azima on 18

January 2012, the payments by Dr Massaad in late November and early

December were for the purpose of acquiring an entirely different shareholding

from Mr Azima.

184.12 Mr Azima denies that the payment of $575,000 related to the SPA on the basis

that the payments were not made to the payee account specified in in the SPA.

However, that explanation ignores the fact that, as evidenced by the

contemporaneous email correspondence, Dr Massaad attempted

unsuccessfully to make a payment of $450,000 pursuant to the SPA to the

specified account after which he made a replacement payment of that amount

to Mr Azima’s personal account, followed by a payment of a further $125,000

to the same account a few days later. It follows that the payment of $450,000

(and, logically, the payment of $125,000 made by Dr Massaad to the same

account several days later) were made pursuant to the SPA between Mr Azima

and Dr Massaad. In other words, those payments did not “reimburse” Mr

Azima anything. Rather, they were made in exchange for Mr Azima’s shares

in Eurasia Aviation.

184.13 It is common ground that in early 2012 Eurasia purchased a Hawker 400XP

for approximately $1.63 million. The Eurasia cash flow spreadsheet shows

that as at January 2013, Dr Massaad had paid a total of $1,100,866 into Eurasia

Aviation. In addition, according to a letter dated 21 January 2020 from Mr

Azima’s solicitors, between April 2013 and April 2014, Dr Massaad made

payments totalling approximately $530,000 to Eurasia Aviation. It follows

that by April 2014 (1) Dr Massaad had paid a total of approximately $1.63m

into Eurasia Aviation; (2) Eurasia Aviation owned a Hawker 400XP aircraft

worth approximately $1.63 million; and (3) Dr Massaad owned all of the

shares in Eurasia Aviation. Accordingly, those payments did not have the

effect of reimbursing Mr Azima the sum of $500,000.

56

185. Mr Azima contends that RAKIA’s case is flawed for the following main reasons.

185.1 RAKIA’s case rests on the premise that Mr Azima had no legitimate basis to

receive the referral fee whereas Mr Azima was entitled to a fee as payment for

his introduction of the Potential Buyers.

185.2 RAKIA’s case presupposes that Mr Azima paid a bribe after the amount of his

commission had been halved and to the very person who reduced the

commission, which is not credible.

185.3 In any event, the funds paid to Dr Massaad were not a bribe at all, but rather

a payment made towards the acquisition of a share in an aircraft. The money

was later repaid after that transaction did not proceed and Mr Azima and Dr

Massaad purchased a different aircraft.

185.4 The contemporaneous correspondence shows that in 2011 Mr Azima had been

undertaking a search for executive jets, including Hawker aircraft.

185.5 Mr Azima was considering acquiring an interest in a Hawker 800A operated

by Dana Jets in which he understood Dr Massaad to have an interest. He

agreed with Dr Massaad to acquire half of Dr Massaad’s 50% share, for

$500,000, since this was 25% of the hull value of $2,000,000. In parallel, Mr

Azima and Mr Adams prepared proposals for the aircraft to be leased to Mr

Azima’s executive charter airline in Georgia. The purpose of the proposed

purchase and lease arrangements was to allow the aircraft to be operated in

Georgia.

185.6 Mr Azima recorded the $500,000 payment against Dr Massaad’s name in a list

(of 28 January 2012) of payments made and received. It would be odd for a

person who had paid a bribe to record it in that way.

185.7 Ultimately, the proposals for purchasing the Hawker 800A were not pursued

as RAKIA found a buyer interested in purchasing Dana outright. Mr Adams

advised Mr Azima on 25 January 2012: “Dear Farhad, Had a very good

meeting. He said he can't firmly commit before next week as they are selling

Dana and the Hawker is supposed to be part [sic] of the sale.”

185.8 As a result, he and Dr Massaad instead acquired a Hawker 400XP. The aircraft

was to be held by Eurasia Aviation of which Mr Azima would be the sole

shareholder. It was subsequently decided that the shares in Eurasia Aviation

were to be allocated 50/50 between Mr Azima and Dr Massaad so Mr Adams

shared the specifications for the aircraft with Dr Massaad: “Dear Dr. Massaad,

Farhad asked that I forward the attached regarding the Hawker 400: Draft

purchase contract, specs, and photos of the Hawker 400 aircraft. The aircraft

will be purchased by the BVI company and Farhad has already made the down

payment.”

185.9 A contract for purchase of the Hawker 400XP by Eurasia Aviation for a price

of $1,625,000 was signed on 23 February 2012 and the purchase completed in

57

April 2012. Ultimately, the $500,000 paid by Mr Azima to Dr Massaad was

repaid as a result of these transactions. A total of $575,000 was paid by Dr

Massaad to Mr Azima in November 2012. That figure is the sum of the

$500,000 advanced to Dr Massaad in January 2012 and a further $75,000, to

balance out the contributions that had been made towards the purchase of the

Hawker 400XP by Dr Massaad and Mr Azima. As an email exchange between

them in October 2012 set out, Mr Azima had contributed $150,000 more

towards the purchase than Dr Massaad had done. Dr Massaad’s payment of

$75,000 to Mr Azima therefore left the position square between them.

185.10 Mr Adams explained that various payments were made by Dr Massaad to Mr

Azima over this period, for different purposes. There were, as he put it, funds in

three buckets, or “pockets” that were owed by Dr Massaad: $375,000 for his

share in the Hawker 400XP; $500,000 for the return of the money that was put

on the Hawker 800A; and $525,000 pursuant to the SPA. These three amounts

were paid appropriately.

185.11 RAKIA’s case that the payments made by Dr Massaad, totalling $1.63m,

represented the cost of the Hawker 400XP Aircraft acquired by Eurasia of

which he was the sole shareholder, and did not entail any reimbursement to

Mr Azima the sum of $500,000, is misconceived since it ignores the fact that

the purchase of the Hawker 400XP (which was purchased for $1.625 million)

had been funded by a loan of $1,000,000. As at 31 July 2012, the amount

outstanding was recorded as around $1.101 million. RAKIA’s theory that Dr

Massaad’s payments to Mr Azima were made in order to acquire 90%

ownership of the aircraft therefore makes no sense. Mr Azima only owned half

of a minority of the equity in the aircraft; if RAKIA’s theory were right, the

payments made to Mr Azima would result in him being grossly overpaid and

Dr Massaad being left out of pocket.

185.12 Thus, RAKIA’s late attempt to rebut Mr Azima’s evidence that the $500,000

payment was legitimate and was repaid in any event is simply confused and

should be rejected.

Conclusion

186. RAKIA’s case that the payment of the $500,000 was a bribe paid to Dr Massaad rests

essentially on the inference to be drawn from the fact that the payment was made on

the date Mr Azima received a fee authorised by Dr Massaad to which he had no

entitlement and the absence of any convincing alternative explanation for the

payment.

187. In my judgment, the explanation put forward by Mr Azima that the payment was in

exchange for a 25% interest in the Hawker 800A aircraft does not stand up to scrutiny

in the absence of any documentary evidence showing that Dr Massaad had any

interest in the aircraft or documentary evidence of the proposed purchase transaction.

188. The reasons for the various payments subsequently made by Dr Massaad to Mr Azima

are unclear. Dr Massaad at no stage made a repayment of the sum of $500,000. He

58

made a payment of $575,000 in November 2012 but again there is no documentary

evidence to link this payment with the $500,000 paid by Mr Azima some ten months

earlier. On the other hand, RAKIA’s attempt to explain the various payments made

by Dr Massaad as referable to the acquisition of the Hawk 400XP breaks down

because it fails to account for the loan finance of $1 million, as submitted by Mr

Azima.

189. The lack of any clear explanation for the subsequent payments made by Dr Massaad

does not, however, displace the inference to be drawn from the unexplained payment

of $500,000 by Mr Azima which I conclude was a bribe.

(c) Did Mr Azima wrongfully fail to disclose to RAKIA an intended interest in the

Hotel?

190. RAKIA’s case is as follows:

190.1 Prior to entering into the purported Referral Agreement, Mr Azima had

reached an agreement with Mr Hosseinpour that, upon completion of the sale

of the Hotel to Eurasia Hotel Holdings Limited he would receive a 10%

interest in the Hotel in exchange for a nominal payment of $10 (the “Transfer

Agreement”).

190.2 If (contrary to RAKIA’s primary case) the Referral Agreement was not, in

fact, a sham document, but rather (as Mr Azima alleges) a valid agreement,

then Mr Azima’s actions in entering the Transfer Agreement, and the

assistance that he provided to the Potential Buyers, breached Mr Azima’s

obligations under the Referral Agreement, in particular the obligations of

loyalty owed by Mr Azima as RAKIA’s agent, reflected in Clause 1, which

provided as follows:

“DUTIES OF AZIMA AZIMA warrants that he has: (a) provided to RAKIA

all relevant information to date in his possession which relates to the Hotel

Transaction…; and (b) acted in good faith and with the utmost professional

integrity and in the best interests of RAKIA in any transaction with third

parties relating to the Hotel Transaction…”.

190.3 Mr Azima’s conduct in relation to the Transfer Agreement was inconsistent

with that duty. In particular,

(a) the existence of the Transfer Agreement was clearly “relevant

information” which relates to the Hotel Transaction which Mr Azima

should have disclosed;

(b) by entering into the “Transfer Agreement”, Mr Azima deliberately put

himself in a position where he was likely to profit significantly from the

sale of the Hotel despite owing a fiduciary duty to RAKIA in respect of

that sale. He therefore knowingly breached his fiduciary duty to RAKIA

under Clause 1 of the Referral Agreement.

59

190.4 Mr Azima claims that the Ruler knew and approved of the proposal that Mr

Azima would acquire a 10% interest in the Hotel. This claim is not

corroborated by any documentary evidence and is directly contradicted by the

Ruler’s witness evidence.

190.5 Mr Azima’s claim that Dr Massaad and Gela Mikadze (CEO of RAK

Georgia) also knew and approved of his intended 10% interest in the Hotel is

similarly unsupported by any documentary evidence. In any event, since both

Dr Massaad and Mr Mikadze were engaged in an unlawful conspiracy to

defraud RAKIA, even if they knew and approved of this arrangement, their

knowledge and approval would not be imputable to RAKIA.

191. Mr Azima’s response is, in summary, as follows:

191.1 RAKIA contends that the Transfer Agreement document referring to the

10% share provides only for the payment of nominal consideration

whereas it refers to the payment of “other good and valuable

60

consideration”. The $10 simply represented an intended contribution to

the company's formation capital of $100. If the sale had gone ahead, all

shareholders would have made further contributions proportionate to

their shareholding and the final, total purchase price. RAKIA did not

challenge Mr Azima’s position on this point.

191.2 Contemporaneous documents show that Mr Azima’s proposed interest

was known by various officials at RAKIA (including but not limited to

Mr Mikadze, Dr Massaad, and Mr Khawaja), RAKIA’s external lawyers

and third parties.

Conclusion

192. Given my finding that the Referral Agreement was not a genuine agreement, the

question of whether Mr Azima’s conduct was in breach of that agreement does not

arise.

193. Had the Referral Agreement been genuine, it would have been necessary to determine

whether Mr Azima had provided to RAKIA all relevant information relating to the

terms on which he was to acquire an interest in Eurasia Hotel Holdings Limited and

acted in good faith and with the utmost professional integrity and in the best interests

of RAKIA in any transaction with third parties relating to the Hotel transaction.

194. The unsigned Transfer Agreement indicates that it was envisaged by Mr Azima and

the Potential Buyers that he would acquire a 10% interest in Eurasia Hotel Holdings

Limited in return for a nominal payment of $10 together with “other good and

valuable consideration”. It is unclear what that additional consideration means

although emails between Mr Azima and Mr Hosseinpour on 25 November 2011

indicate that the consideration would be funded as to half by cash and half by

finance from the other Potential Buyers.

195. Mr Azima referred to email correspondence with RAKIA’s in-house and external

counsel in which it was recognised that Mr Azima was to be a principal on the buyers’

side. However, there is no evidence of any express disclosure of his intended 10%

stake in Eurasia Hotel Holdings Limited or of the terms on which that stake would

be acquired. In the absence of documentary evidence, I do not accept Mr Azima’s

evidence that the Ruler knew and approved of the proposal that Mr Azima would

acquire a 10% interest in the Hotel.

196. In short, if I had found that the Referral Agreement was a genuine agreement, I would

have concluded that the failure by Mr Azima to give full disclosure to RAKIA of his

intended interest in the Hotel was in breach of Clause 1 of the Referral Agreement.

61

(d) Did Mr Azima orchestrate a malicious campaing to damage the reputation,

standing and internal stability of the Governmetn of RAK?

197. RAKIA’s pleaded case is that Mr Azima played a central role in “instigating and

coordinating a wide-ranging media and public relations campaign which sought to

denigrate the reputation of the Ruler and the governing authorities in RAK, including

by deceiving institutions and companies in RAK into entering commercial transactions

and entities with individuals involved in serious criminality.”

198. The alleged misconduct was then said in RAKIA’s response to a Part 18 request to

have the following aspects:

198.1 the planning and implementation, in 2014 and 2015, of "Project Clay”, a

coordinated programme designed to frustrate RAKIA's attempts to pursue

legal remedies against Dr Massaad by procuring and promoting the

widespread publication of damaging false stories in the international media;

198.2 the procuring of the publication of such stories, alleging that individuals were

being unlawfully detained in a "Dungeon" operated by the Ruler of RAK and

RAKIA's lawyers (Dechert LLP) and that the Ruler of RAK had improperly

abdicated judicial, prosecutorial and governmental functions to unlicensed UK

lawyers, who were overseeing the operation of a secret prison in RAK; and

198.3 the preparation and, it is to be inferred, implementation of the "Security

Assessment" (which is explained further below).

199. Mr Azima submitted that the “campaign claim” is hopeless for, amongst others, the

following reasons:

199.1 RAKIA failed to prove the falsity of the stories that were said to have been

procured and promoted by Mr Azima;

199.2 There was no evidence of any media stories having been published;

199.3 The Security Assessment was not implemented and it was not procured by Mr

Azima.

200. RAKIA’s case therefore gives rise to the following issues:

200.1 Has RAKIA established that the stories that were allegedly planned and

promoted by Mr Azima were false?

200.2 What was Mr Azima’s role in relation to the Security Assessment and was it

implemented?

62

Were the stories false?

201. Mr Azima submits that:

201.1 RAKIA failed to adduce any evidence in its witness statements that the stories

said to have been procured and promoted by Mr Azima were in fact false;

201.2 RAKIA attempted to fill this gap through a series of leading questions to Mr

Gerrard in re-examination in which Mr Gerrard denied that he had been

involved in illegal detentions in RAK or had taken on prosecutorial or judicial

roles. Mr Gerrard’s answers, elucidated in this way at the end of his evidence,

were simply not a sufficient basis for this Court to find that the “falsity” of any

alleged media stories is established.

201.3 This is particularly so in circumstances where there was evidence showing that

concern at detentions in RAK was well-founded, and there was also evidence

of Mr Gerrard’s and/or Dechert’s role in those detentions giving rise to

legitimate concerns. It was incumbent on RAKIA to address these issues with

evidence, which it has not even attempted to do.

201.4 Mr Azima referred to a November 2014 Amnesty International report referring

to several cases in which individuals had in fact been detained for long periods

in the Ruler’s palace or in other undisclosed locations. None of RAKIA’s

witnesses were in a position to refute its findings.

201.5 Reports had been provided to Mr Azima about Mr Gerrard conducting (on

behalf of the Ruler and/or RAKIA) highly aggressive and unlawful

interrogations of prisoners including Mr Al Sadeq; and aggressively

threatening Mr Al Sadeq’s wife and threatening one of RAKIA’s opponents

(Mr Izadpanah) with prison unless he agreed to pay $7.5 million to RAK, and

offering clemency in exchange.

201.6 Under cross-examination, Mr Gerrard accepted that he had in fact interviewed

Mr Al Sadeq and other individuals while in prison in RAK. He also admitted

investigating and interviewing Mr Izadpanah in RAK.

201.7 If RAKIA was to sustain its case that complaints about these practices in RAK

were false, disclosure should have been given of these incidents including of

the records of interview that Mr Gerrard said would exist. This is particularly

so given that Mr Gerrard’s own account of Mr Al Sadeq’s interview in

detention itself raised concerns. Mr Gerrard claimed that the interview had

been conducted strictly pursuant to the standards in the Police and Criminal

Evidence Act 1984 although it became clear in Mr Gerrard’s evidence that this

was not true. No audio recording of the interview was made and he was unsure

whether a record of the interview had been provided to Mr Al Sadeq’s lawyers.

Mr Al Sadeq was detained in RAK without charge for at least a year. Mr

Gerrard accepted that he interviewed Mr Al Sadeq at some point during that

detention, before he was charged.

63

201.8 Mr Gerrard saw no problem with an individual being detained for a prolonged

period without charge and being interrogated in that period: “They have a

process. It is not like ours -- many parts of it are -- and he agreed to talk to us

whilst he was detained. We followed the process of PACE when we met him.”

As noted, the claim that PACE was followed was not correct, on Mr Gerrard’s

own evidence.

Conclusion

202. In order to make good its case that Mr Azima procured and promoted false stories in

the media, it was incumbent on RAKIA to establish that the stories which it was

intended to publish about human rights violations were untrue. It has not done so. It

appears that Project Clay intended to draw attention to actual cases of detention and

illegality, not fabricated cases. The 2014 Amnesty International Report indicates that

there were real grounds for concern about detention procedures in RAK. None of

RAKIA’s witnesses were in a position to refute the findings in that report.

Mr Azima’s role in relation to the Security Assessment

203. The facts relating to the Security Assessment as they appear from the documents

before the Court were as follows:

203.1 In late 2014 Mr Azima was engaged by Mr Kirby Behre, a lawyer at Miller &

Chevalier, lawyers who acted for Dr Massaad (and later Mr Azima) to act as

a consultant to assist with a PR campaign involving the investigation of human

rights abuses in RAK for the benefit of Dr Massaad who had fled RAK and

was in dispute with RAKIA and the government of RAK.

203.2 Mr Azima introduced former CIA operative Scott Modell to Dr Massaad and

Miller & Chevalier and commissioned him to produce the Security

Assessment and was responsible for arranging Mr Modell’s remuneration for

producing it.

203.3 The Security Assessment consisted of a review of the security issues

affecting Dr Massaad including a detailed series of “Recommendations”

which included “aggressive tools” and “offensive media operations” to

“display the critical weak points of the RAK”, using media teams to

“denigrate the reputation of Sheikh Saud and the RAK as a place of doing

business”, and a campaign going beyond negative stories and including:

“Organized protests and other forms of manufactured dissent, sustained over

an extended period of time”.

203.4 The Security Assessment also included a recommendation for “orchestrating

business deals in RAK with disreputable individuals from other parts of the

world” setting out how the RAK Government, the ruling family and RAK-

owned banks and businesses could be deceptively lured into entering

64

transactions with serious criminals (including “Latin American drug cartel

figures”) and deliberately exposed to “Scams, fraud and deceptive

partnerships”, with the aim of causing the RAK authorities and, in particular,

Crown Prince Mohammad to lose large sums of money and of leading to

exposure which would serve as a lasting source of shame.

204. Mr Azima accepted in cross-examination that he made comments on this document.

In his witness statement, Mr Azima described the portion of the Security Assessment

report that appeared to be a proposal for future work as “naïve and ill-conceived”.

There is no evidence that he criticised the assessment at the time it was being

prepared. In cross-examination he also claimed (for the first time) that he told Mr

Modell to “take…out” all the suggestions of illegal and deceptive activity from the

Security Assessment. There is no indication in the contemporaneous correspondence

that he gave any such instruction. He sent the final version of the report – including

what he now claims is objectionable material – to Mr Behre for use by Dr Massaad.

205. Mr Azima sought to justify his involvement in these matters on the basis that Mr

Modell was retained to “investigate allegations of RAK’s substantial human rights

abuses which Dr Massaad was concerned about, particularly absentee trials which he

wanted to avoid happening to him”. This description of Mr Modell’s work is not

borne out by the Security Assessment which did not propose an investigation into

human rights abuses but advocated a media campaign highlighting the absence of

fundamental legal rights in RAK as a means of embarrassing the RAK authorities and

compelling the UAE authorities “to rein in RAK aggression against the Client.”

206. There is moreover no evidence that Mr Azima actually carried out any investigation

into human rights abuses. Although he claims to have spoken to Mr Al Sadeq when

he was in prison and to his wife, Mr Azima does not claim to have investigated

whether Mr Al Sadeq’s claims were true or to have commissioned anyone else to do

so.

207. When the allegation of involvement in the campaign was added to the Particulars of

Claim by amendment in July 2018 Mr Azima did not seek to defend his role on the

basis that he was “investigating human rights” but, rather, denied that he had “any

role” in such a campaign.

208. Mr Azima also engaged in discussions with Mr Modell about using other possible

“high risk, high impact” tactics against the “enemy” including possible “Black Bag”

methods. Mr Azima admitted during cross-examination that this was a reference to

the use of “Illegal operation[s]”.

209. Mr Azima’s evidence, which I accept, was that the media campaign proposed in the

Security Assessment was never put into effect and that no adverse publicity resulted

from it. RAKIA has not attempted to prove that there actually was any media

campaign or stories (false or otherwise) in the media at all. As Mr Azima said in

cross-examination:

65

“A. That was not my intent. Nothing happened. There's -- no propaganda was

made; no article was written to the best of my knowledge. Nothing happened.

The campaign never got started.”

210. In summary, Mr Azima oversaw the commissioning of and payment for the Security

Assessment report drafted by Mr Modell which included a plan for drawing attention

to human rights’ abuses in RAK as a means of inflicting significant financial and

reputational damage against various RAK institutions and companies. Mr Azima

provided comments on the Security Assessment but did not object to any of the

proposals which it contained. The Security Assessment was not in the event

implemented.

(d) Did Mr Azima make representations relating to the Proposed ISR JV?

211. In late 2015 and early 2016 RAKIA engaged in discussions with Mr Azima and other

individuals with whom he was collaborating regarding a proposed joint venture for

the provision of ISR services. The proposed partners for the proposed ISR were

RAKIA and Global Defence Services Corporation (“GDS“). GDS was specifically

formed for the purpose of the Proposed ISR JV. Mr Azima was a major shareholder

and director of GDS which operated from the same office address in Kansas City as

Mr Azima’s company ALG Transportation.

212. RAKIA alleges that Mr Azima was aware that the joint venture proposal submitted

by GDS to RAKIA grossly overstated the value of the aircraft that would be acquired

by the joint venture SPV, and that, if RAKIA had participated in the joint venture on

the terms proposed by Mr Azima, it would have contributed approximately $20

million more than would have been fair to acquire its interest in the joint venture. It

alleges that during the course of the discussions and negotiations concerning the

Proposed ISR JV in late 2015 and early 2016 Mr Azima made five deliberate false

representations to RAKIA and failed to correct other false representations made by

the individuals with whom he was collaborating.

213. Mr Azima submits that:

213.1 RAKIA‘s case in respect of the Proposed ISR JV serves only to highlight the

“highly artificial” nature of its claims overall and to provide confirmation of

the vendetta pursued by RAKIA to vex Mr Azima and damage his reputation.

213.2 RAKIA’s case that Mr Azima had sought to deceive was implausible given

that any deception would have come to light at the stage of the due diligence

stage performed by RAKIA‘s experienced advisers who included KPMG and

Air Vice Marshall Hobart;

213.3 Mr Azima was happy to deal with RAKIA’s experienced counsel;

66

213.4 Mr Azima’s side comprised experienced ex-military officers including Major

General John Holmes. RAKIA’s case would necessarily be that those

individuals were also party to the alleged dishonesty which was inherently

unlikely.

(1) Alleged misrepresentations as to the value of the aircraft

214. RAKIA’s case is that Mr Azima misrepresented the value of the aircraft that were to

be acquired by the Proposed ISR JV knowing that the valuation was substantially

misleading.

215. The facts are as follows:

215.1 On 28 December 2015, Mr Azima sent an email to Mr Buchanan which

attached the written proposal “for the formation of a Joint Venture Company

in the Middle East for commercial ISR and defence related services”. The

proposal was drafted by Mr Adams, reviewed by Mr Azima and circulated by

Mr Azima to the participants on the GDS side before being sent to Mr

Buchanan.

215.2 The written proposal stated that the proposed joint venture vehicle would

acquire two King Air and two Falcon aircraft from GDS for a total of

$52,665,252. On that basis, it proposed that RAKIA should “pay GDS US

$21,066,100 for 40.00% of the two (2) King Air ISR Assets and the two (2)

Falcon ISR Assets.”

215.3 The written proposal described the proposed joint venture as follows:

(a) A special purpose vehicle would be formed, to be called GDS Middle

East, and to be held, as to 60% by GDS, and as to 40% by RAKIA.

(b) The assets to be placed into the SPV by GDS would include two King

Air aircraft valued for the purposes of the proposal at $17 million each, and

two Falcon aircraft valued for the purposes of the proposal at $9,332,626

each, giving the assets of the Proposed ISR JV a total value of $52,665,252.

(c) For its 40% stake in the proposed joint venture, RAKIA would contribute

the sum of $21,066,100, being 40% of the purported value of the aircraft to

be acquired.

(d) In addition, RAKIA would contribute working capital of $2 million,

being 40% of the working capital purportedly required by the joint venture.

(e) Following payment of the said sums, GDS would transfer the aircraft to

the SPV free of liens and encumbrances.

67

216. Attached to the written proposals were detailed technical specifications for the King

Air ISR aircraft and Falcon aircraft. Those specifications showed that all four aircraft

were already equipped with ISR technology and systems. The specifications also

stated that the “Price/Unit Cost” of each of the King Air aircraft was “$17 million

(aircraft + communications equipment modifications)” and that the “Original Unit

Acquisition Cost” and “Total Acquisition Cost” of each of the two Falcon aircraft

was $9,332,626.

217. RAKIA’s case is that these references to the “Price/Unit Cost” and “Acquisition

Cost” were unambiguous statements concerning the amount that GDS would actually

pay to acquire the aircraft, and not (as Mr Azima asserted in his oral evidence)

“budgetary number, generic numbers”. RAKIA alleges that the true value of the

aircraft was in fact just $6m. It relies on various documents not shown to RAKIA at

the time, for example:

217.1 On 9 October 2015, Mr Lepper sent an email to Mr Azima which stated: “F,

just spoke with AGD systems. Here is what we can do: If AGD stays in the

sale and operating deal with us at 50/50 profit share he will sell us the aircrafts

at his cost… The Falcon and the King airs are around 1.5M…”

217.2 A draft “Letter of Intent” from Mr Lepper dated 8 January 2016 stated in

respect of the two King Air aircraft that: “Buyer will purchase the Aircraft as

is, where is” for One Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars

($1,500,000 USD) each, hereafter the “Purchase Price” for a total Purchase

Price of Three Million U.S. dollars ($3,000,000) USD.”

217.3 On 21 January 2016, Mr Lepper sent an email to Mr Azima and Mr Adams

which stated (amongst other things) that: “I have just sent the email out

confirming that the 4 ISR aircraft were secured (and can prove ownership) …I

had to personally sign 4 promissory notes for 1.5M for each aircraft for a 6

month control period.”

217.4 On 14 February 2016, Mr Lepper sent an email to Mr Azima and Mr Jacobs

(copying Mr Adams) stating (amongst other things) that: “We all agree that all

four aircraft will be a part of the GDS package 2 ISR king airs and 2 ISR

falcons at 1.5 each, not just the two king airs… Each aircraft will be bought at

$1.5m each. Total 6M”.

218. Accordingly, rather than being worth a total of $52.6 million, the four King Air and

Falcon aircraft were in fact worth a total of just $6 million – about a tenth of what

was represented by Mr Azima to RAKIA in the written proposal. At no point during

the negotiations did Mr Azima disclose to RAKIA that GDS was planning to acquire

the aircraft for just $6 million.

219. Mr Azima contends, in summary as follows.

68

219.1 RAKIA’s case on the December proposal has been presented in different (and

contradictory) ways in its pleadings and witness statements, at different stages

alleging a misrepresentation as to the cost of the aircraft to be provided, and at

others as to their value. RAKIA’s skeleton argument now indicates that the case

it pursues is that a misrepresentation was made as to the value of the aircraft.

RAKIA’s case is therefore that Mr Azima made a false representation that the

aircraft the subject of the proposal were “worth more than $52.6m”.

219.2 The December proposal provided an estimated value of a fully equipped ISR

project, which comprises not simply the aircraft but an array of highly

sophisticated and expensive military equipment, operated by a trained crew,

with official authorisation. The value of a fully equipped aircraft is not

comparable to the acquisition cost of aircraft without any ISR equipment, crew

or authorisations.

219.3 The December proposal also made clear that the contribution from GDS’s side

was not simply the aircraft, but rather a fully operational ISR service:

“Operational Business Plan. GDS Middle East will offer all four (4) ISR

Aircraft (2 x King Air and 2 x Falcons as part of a fully managed operational

and manned ISR service (including flight personnel, engineering staff, and ISR

expertise, both on the aircraft and on the ground)”.

219.4 Mr Azima’s evidence was that the figures indicated in the December proposal

were simply indicative. Moreover, as Mr Azima explained, the nature of those

figures as only indicative was obvious, because the range of equipment used

(and hence the cost and value) would depend both on the customer’s

requirements, and on the government approvals that could be obtained. A

reasonable and knowledgeable person would understand that defence articles

are subject to approval of United States Government.

220. In my judgment, the December proposal was clearly representing to RAKIA that the

values ascribed to the four aircraft were the acquisition costs and not the value of the

aircraft once ISR equipped and operated by SR professionals. Mr Azima’s case that

the amounts specified in the December proposal included the cost of ISR equipping

is contradicted by contemporaneous documents.

220.1 On 16 October 2015 Mr Azima sent an email to Mr Buchanan attaching the

specifications for the two Falcon aircraft. This email stated that the “Total

Acquisition Cost” of each aircraft was $9,332,626 which is exactly the same

value specified in the written proposal. In his email, Mr Azima stated: “Please

note price included is the aircraft only. Modifications and Electronics are not

mentioned.”

220.2 The detailed technical information concerning the two Falcon aircraft in the

written proposal stated that $9,332,626 is the “Original Unit Acquisition Cost”

and the “Total Acquisition Costs” of the aircraft. Those expressions clearly

indicate that $9,332,626 was the amount that the joint venture would need to

pay in order to acquire ownership of the aircraft (i.e. the cost price), rather than

69

a figure that also sought to factor in other operational and support services that

would be provided under the joint venture.

220.3 This is reinforced by the fact that the amount of $9,332,626 is a specific figure,

rather than a round number (which would be expected if it was intended to

represent a notional projection/estimate of future value based on an array of as

yet un-quantified costs and services). If, as Mr Azima stated in his witness

statement, the cost of equipping the aircraft with ISR technology was unknown

and would have been difficult to estimate at that stage, since the parties had

not yet agreed on the particular ISR services and the required equipment that

the joint venture would offer, the figure communicated to RAKIA is unlikely

to have included any such unknown and incalculable component with such

seeming precision.

220.4 The aircraft were already ISR-equipped at the time of the negotiations so that

to that extent it would not be necessary for further amounts to be spent on the

ISR equipment over and above the acquisition cost. The written proposal

contains detailed descriptions of their existing ISR equipment and capabilities.

For example: The description of the two King Air aircraft explained that the

aircraft “hosts a number of Army Intelligence, Surveillance and

Reconnaissance/Reconnaissance Surveillance and Target Acquisition

(ISR/RSTA) sensor systems”. The description of the two Falcon aircraft also

referred to the existence of “APS-143B multi-mode radar”; “EO/IR and

tactical work station”; “side-looking airborne radar”; “the F-16’s APG-66

multi-mode pulse-doppler radar”; “incremental upgrades to its FLOT turret”;

and “360’ scanning AN/APS- 143BV3 inverse synthetic aperture radar

(ISAR)”.

220.5 The contemporaneous emails show Mr Azima and his associates were aware

that the values represented to RAKIA in the written proposal were inflated

and that if RAKIA entered into the Proposed ISR JV on the basis of those

valuations then Mr Azima and his associates would receive a significant

windfall. In an email sent by Mr Adams to Mr Daniels on 26 January 2016,

Mr Adams referred to the upfront cash contribution of $22 million from

RAKIA, leaving $10 million to distribute to the partners in GDS, describing

the deal as “terrific”. On the same date, Mr Adams sent a further email to Mr

Jacobs, Mr Azima, Mr Lepper and Mr Daniels which stated: “The economics

of the deal are exceptional and are as good or better than anything I have seen

in my 35 years in the aviation business because the upfront risk is mitigated”.

Mr Lepper replied to this email on the same date stating: “I know everyone is

working very hard to get this deal done. As we all know this would be a

tremendous payday. In speaking for myself, this would be a truly life

changing event as I am currently in a very unstable financial position.” Mr

Lepper then sent out six “recommendations”, the last of which was:

“Distribute the 10M, have a cocktail and laugh about this”.

220.6 Mr Azima’s case that the discussions regarding the Proposed ISR JV were

“preliminary commercial discussions” and that, by their very nature, the

70

positions of RAKIA and its counterparties “would be opposed and

adversarial” on a large number of issues does not properly reflect the nature

of the discussions which concerned a proposed joint venture in which it was

to be expected that the parties would cooperate and have a greater regard for

each other’s interests that in an ordinary commercial relationship. Moreover,

I accept RAKIA’s submission that, even if two parties have “opposed and

adversarial” interests in the context of ongoing commercial discussions, this

does not entitle either party to mislead the other as to the value of assets

which it is contributing. A party acting in “good faith” and with the utmost

professional integrity would disclose the true position in relation to the assets

they were contributing.

(2) Alleged representation that GDS was licensed

221. On 25 January 2016, Mr Lepper sent an email to Mr Buchanan which stated as

follows:

“Please do not take my directness as disrespect, apologies if it was taken as

such. I understand you are under controls of protocol and due diligence. As you

will read below and was firmly explained to me, we are as well. We are a

licensed weapons dealer with many restrictions and oversight controls. The

attachment document officially outlines the required course of action for the

TAA and legal guidelines which we must follow. […]”

222. RAKIA contends as follows.

222.1 The email constituted a clear and express representation that GDS was

licensed to sell weapons by the relevant US regulatory authorities and that,

contrary to the assertion in that email, GDS was not a licensed weapons dealer

and was not registered under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations

(“ITAR”).

222.2 Mr Azima’s pleaded case and witness evidence concedes that GDS was not

registered under ITAR.

222.3 Despite being copied to Mr Lepper’s email, and despite knowing that GDS

was not a licensed weapons dealer and that RAKIA was likely to rely on the

false representation that it was, Mr Azima failed to correct Mr Lepper’s false

representation.

223. Mr Azima’s case is in summary as follows:

223.1 He denies that Mr Lepper was making any representation on his behalf. Mr

Lepper’s email was not on its face representing Mr Azima’s position. It was

sent from Mr Lepper’s JFJ International email address, it was explaining the

position of AGD (whose email on the subject of arms controls Mr Lepper was

forwarding), and it did not refer to GDS at all in any way.

71

223.2 Mr Azima understood the email to refer to AGD’s position and he believed

AGD to have been registered under the ITAR.

223.3 In any event, it was subsequently made clear to Mr Buchanan that GDS was

not registered under the ITAR.

223.4 RAKIA has offered no evidence to dispute Mr Azima’s evidence that Mr

Buchanan was informed that GDS was not a weapons dealer. Mr Azima’s

account in this regard is supported by a later note taken by Dechert of a

meeting attended by Mr Buchanan, at which it was noted that there were

different options for structuring the joint venture, which would include the

need to obtain ITAR authorisations: “Option 2 was for FA to take the lead

through ACG0 or GDS and get the necessary ITAR authorizations.”

224. In my judgment, RAKIA’s case in relation to this alleged misrepresentation is lacking

in substance. For the reasons advanced by Mr Azima, I am not satisfied that the

statement in the email of 26 January 2016 that “we are a licensed weapons dealer”

was made on behalf of Mr Azima, or that it was referring to GDS. I also accept the

unchallenged evidence of Mr Azima that it was made clear to Mr Buchanan that it

would be necessary for GDS to obtain the necessary authorisiations.

(3) Alleged representation that the Technical Assistance Agreement was produced

or approved by the US State Department

225. Mr Lepper’s email dated 25 January 2016 attached a document which purported on

its face to be issued by the Directorate of Trade Controls at the US Department of

State (“the TAA Document”). In particular:

225.1 The written title of the TAA Document was “U.S. Department of State –

Directorate of Defense Trade Controls”.

225.2 The electronic title of the TAA Document (shown in the covering email) was

“U.S. DEPT OF STATE – GUIDELINE – TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

AGREEMENT”.

225.3 The TAA Document bore the official crest of the US State Department.

225.4 The TAA Document contained explanatory text (in bold) which stated: “The

Department of State is responsible for the export and temporary import of

defense articles and services governed by 22 U.S.C. 2778 of the Arms Export

Control Act…and Executive Order 13637.” Further: “The following points are

intended to provide an understanding of a Technical Assistance Agreement

(TAA) defined by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Of

course, these do not replace the regulations defined by the ITAR. The ITAR

is controlled and executed by Defense Trade Controls (DTC) which is a

directorate under the State Department.”

72

225.5 Mr Lepper’s covering email stated: “The attached document officially outlines

the required course of action for the TAA and legal guidelines which we must

follow”.

226. RAKIA’s case is as follows:

226.1 These documents, in particular the use of the word “officially” were clearly

intended to convey the false impression that the TAA Document was an

official State Department publication.

226.2 Contrary to the impression conveyed by the TAA Document and Mr Lepper’s

email, the document was not, in fact, produced by the US Department of State.

226.3 Mr Azima does not dispute this. Rather, he asserts that he “does not know why

the document in question contains the State Department logo” and that he “did

not add the logo to the document”.

226.4 Mr Azima was copied the email from Mr Lepper to Mr Buchanan and received

the false document attached to it. Despite this, he took no steps to correct the

false representation that the TAA Document was an official US State

Department document.

227. Mr Azima’s response is as follows:

227.1 There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Lepper (still less Mr Azima) added

the seal of the US Department of State to the document; Mr Daniels of AGD

had sent a document to Mr Lepper, which Mr Lepper appears then to have

forwarded to Mr Buchanan.

227.2 In any event, it is very difficult to see where this complaint would lead even if

it had any substance. RAKIA makes no suggestion that the contents of the

document were in any way incorrect. Moreover, the requirements of the ITAR

were later discussed in detail between the parties, both of which were

represented by counsel. It was made clear by Timothy O’Toole (Miller &

Chevalier) that RAK would need to through the ITAR approval process before

the project could move forward. This approval would need to be obtained by

RAK at the Federal level i.e. the approval would need to be provided by the

US Government (State Department) to the UAE.

228. In my judgment, this complaint lacks substance. The provenance of the TAA

Document is unclear but there is no evidence that Mr Azima had any hand in the

authoring of that document or the covering email from Mr Lepper. It is not

established that Mr Azima was aware that the designation of the TAA Document as

official was incorrect. Moreover, given that it is not suggested that the contents of

the TAA Document were incorrect, the misrepresentation, such as it was, was in

sufficiently material to found a claim pursuant to Clause 3.2 of the Settlement

Agreement.

73

(4) Alleged representation that Mr Lepper was working to obtain the

approval of the US Government for GDS’ participation in the Proposed

ISR JV

229. On 11 February 2016, Mr Lepper sent an email to Mr Buchanan in which he stated

as follows: “Thank you for your passport documents and I will forward accordingly.

In reference to the meeting agenda, I was just informed of the meeting a few days ago

myself. I am still working the approval processes from the USG. As you know

working with any government entity it may take some time and I will keep you

informed of the process.”

230. RAKIA contends as follows:

230.1 This statement was a clear representation that Mr Lepper had initiated the

process of seeking the US Government’s approval of the Proposed ISR JV and

that he was actively engaging with the US Government department to progress

that process.

230.2 Contrary to Mr Lepper’s representation, no steps had been taken to obtain the

US Government’s approval of the Proposed ISR JV.

230.3 Mr Azima did not contest this in his witness statement or oral testimony.

Instead, he claims that he subsequently “made it clear that, so far as GDS and

its potential partners were concerned, the proposed joint venture partners had

not yet “initiated” an application for an appropriate licence under ITAR”.

230.4 However, while there was subsequent discussion of “the numerous regulatory

steps that had to be completed before the joint venture could proceed”, at no

point did Mr Azima (or anyone else acting on behalf of GDS) inform Mr

Buchanan that Mr Lepper had not actually initiated the process of seeking US

Government approval on or before 12 February 2016.

230.5 Mr Azima wrongly failed to correct Mr Lepper’s misrepresentation. Mr

Azima’s oral evidence was that Mr Lepper was acting with his approval

when he sent the email in question.

230.6 Further, contemporaneous emails show that Mr Azima tasked Mr Lepper with

providing information in connection with “Government approvals”

concerning the proposed joint venture.

230.7 Mr Azima was copied to Mr Lepper’s email, which was itself a reply to an

email from Mr Buchanan to which Mr Azima was also copied. Mr Buchanan’s

email stressed that he required certain information “so we can fully brief the

Investment Committee on my return to RAK”. Mr Azima was therefore aware

that Mr Buchanan intended to rely on information provided by Mr Lepper in

response to that request.

74

231. Mr Azima’s response was as follows:

231.1 Mr Lepper’s email is expressed in non-specific terms;

231.2 In any event, the contention that Mr Azima left the position unclear is baseless.

Mr Azima repeatedly explained to RAKIA that US government approval

would be required, in terms making it clear that it had not been sought:

(a) It was made clear to RAKIA that the approval of the US government in

the form of a Technical Assistance Agreement would first require an

initial agreement to be in place. The email sent to Mr Buchanan on 25

January 2016 said this in terms: “it is critical to have an initial agreement

in place for justification and then to develop and submit the TAA to DTC”.

(b) In an email to Mr Buchanan on 17 February 2016, Mr Azima indicated

the steps that would need to be taken in the future, without suggesting that

they had been initiated: “I would like to summarize our discussion and as

I have state [sic] previously the ISR aircraft are defense articles and as

such ITAR controlled articles; technical data and services cannot be

exported/shared to a foreign person without State Department approval.

In our meeting on the 26th we can discuss the path forward with regards

to a DSP 5 or DSP 73. These licenses will need to be considered for both

the marketing and the permanent or temporary export plan. After our

meeting we will be in a position to initiate/select together a path forward

with the State Department.”

231.3 The requirement for government approval and the steps that the parties would

need to take prospectively before the Proposed ISR JV could proceed were

also discussed in detail between the parties, with their counsel present, as

recorded in RAKIA’s own note of a meeting on 16 March 2016.

231.4 RAKIA failed to deal with any of these contemporaneous documents in cross-

examination.

232. In my judgment, the representation made by Mr Lepper was incorrect and may well

have been intended to give a misleading impression to RAKIA of the steps taken

towards obtaining US Government approval. However, given that those acting on

Mr Azima’s side of the negotiations appear to have made clear soon after the email

was sent that the process of seeking authorisation had not yet started, I regard the

misrepresentation as insufficiently material to found a claim under Clause 3.2 of the

Settlement Agreement.

(5) Alleged representations that the Proposed ISR JV had the backing of the

US Government

75

233. RAKIA alleges that Mr Azima repeatedly represented to RAKIA that the US

Government was supportive of the Proposed ISR JV and was interested in becoming

a customer of its services.

233.1 For example, at a meeting on 26 February 2016, Mr Azima represented that

the US Government, Central Intelligence Agency and US Special Operations

were all intended clients and customers of the Proposed ISR JV. This

representation was recorded in an attendance note produced by RAKIA’s

lawyers, which states: “FA noted that the project would be supported by the

US Government “if you know what I’m saying”. Further: “[Mr Azima] and

WC said that they have talked to many potential clients - the "Northern Client"

is interested, though the "Southern Client" would be more interested once the

company has been set up. After the meeting, Mr Azima told Mr Buchanan that

the "Northern Client" was the US Central Intelligence Agency, while the

"Southern Client" was US Special Ops in Jacksonville, Florida…” Further:

“WC said that they would go back to the potential customer – and FA

interrupted to say “both customers, including the US Government customer”

– to get a sense of their timeline. WC said that the US Government would be

a launch customer.”

233.2 Other contemporaneous documents demonstrate that Mr Azima had clearly

led Mr Buchanan to believe that the US Government supported, and would be

the initial customer of, the Proposed ISR JV. For example:

(a) On 23 January 2016, Mr Buchanan sent an email to Mr Azima which

stated, “You indicated that the US Government is supporting this project”

and requesting sight of any approval provided by the US Government.

(b) On 30 March 2016, Mr Buchanan sent an email to Mr Azima in which

he expressed concern that a draft of the Memorandum of Understanding sent

to him by Mr Azima “makes no reference to USG as a client”. In his evidence

Mr Buchanan explained that he sent this email because “I felt the MOU was

incomplete and didn’t fairly reflect the discussions which had taken place”.

(c) Mr Buchanan’s email dated 30 March 2016 also stated that, “we

discussed exit and you said that would be difficult for us – this I understand

with the proposed US client base”. This clearly reflected Mr Buchanan’s

understanding at the time – based on Mr Azima’s statements to him – that

the US Government would be a client of the Proposed ISR JV.

233.3 In his evidence Mr Buchanan explained how Mr Azima had made it clear that

“firm interest had been expressed by the US Government in being a client of

the services that would be provided by the ISR JV” and “represented on

multiple occasions that the US Government was both supportive of, and

interested in, the services being provided by the ISR JV”. He also stated,

“Throughout the discussions with Mr Azima it was…clear that the US

Government was expected to be the founding client”.

76

233.4 The representation that the US Government supported the Proposed ISR JV

was very important to RAKIA. Mr Buchanan’s evidence was that if the US

Government was not going to be a very early client, “the financials of the

whole project would be …in material question”.

233.5 The contemporaneous documentary evidence demonstrates that the US

Government had not expressed any formal support for the Proposed ISR JV,

nor had it expressed formal interest in becoming a customer. Mr Azima states

that he “certainly hoped that the US Government would become a customer”

but claims that he “made it clear” to Mr Buchanan that “it had not committed

to doing so”. The communications described above, however, demonstrate

that this was not “made…clear” to Mr Buchanan. On the contrary, Mr

Buchanan was deliberately led to believe that the US Government firmly

supported the Proposed ISR JV and would be (or at least was very likely to

be) its principal initial customer. Those statements were not accurate, as Mr

Azima well knew.

234. Mr Azima’s response is, in summary, as follows:

234.1 RAKIA distorts the content of Mr Azima’s statements regarding the interest

of the US Government. Mr Azima explained that, unsurprisingly, he hoped

the US Government would become a customer and that he expected them to

be supportive, as and when the ISR project had become operational.

234.2 The possibility of the US Government being a customer was obviously

discussed, as was the possibility of other possible clients. For example, at the

meeting on 26 February 2016, Mr Buchanan referred to both possibilities:

“[JB] also said that if the US Government is a founding client then the project

would be easy, but if it is another client such as Djibouti then it could take up

to three years to establish the framework.”

234.3 However, it would not have been possible for the government to commit to

doing so before the project had been approved. The parties were well aware of

this given the complex approvals required (as discussed as that same meeting).

234.4 Mr Azima’s evidence was that he believed the US Government would be

clients once the project had become operational: “A. US Government would

have been our clients -- various part of US Government would have been

clients once we are operational.” This understanding was, as he explained,

based on confidential discussions with officials.

234.5 There is a clear difference between a statement that, after the project becomes

operational, the US Government would be supportive, and a statement that

the US Government already actively backed the project and would be a

founding client. This distinction was made clear in the meeting held in

February 2016. Dechert’s note of that meeting records Mr Azima (and a Mr

Carmona (WC)) saying as follows: “JB said that in David’s mind, having the

US Government as a client was a difference maker. David does not believe

that regional customers can generate the level of projected returns discussed

77

to date. FA responded that he had never said that the US Government was a

client, and that came from Mark. WC said that he could not assure JB that if

the deal happens, the US Government would be a customer.”

234.6 Mr Azima’s account is supported by other contemporaneous documents.

Neither of the written proposals submitted to RAKIA from GDS’s/Mr

Azima’s side identified the US government as a client. The later proposal was

prepared by counsel and indeed it defined the likely client base in narrower

terms: “The purpose of this MOU is to set forth certain understandings of the

parties in relation to the terms and conditions to be agreed between ALG and

RAKDL for the formation of a joint venture to provide ISR services to

governmental clients in the UAE and the region, subject to and in full

compliance with applicable laws in the US and in the UAE.”

234.7 Mr Buchanan in fact understood this definition of the client base as excluding

the US government as a possible client. The involvement of counsel and the

drafting of these agreements are plainly inconsistent with the contention that

Mr Azima set out to deceive RAKIA in the manner alleged.

235. In my judgment, RAKIA has failed to establish that Mr Azima misled it, or permitted

it to be misled, with regard to the status of the US Government as a potential client.

Some of Mr Azima’s comments may have overstated the level of commitment but the

note of the meeting on 16 February 2016 made clear that the US Government was not

committed to being a customer.

(3) Was the Good Faith Representation false?

236. RAKIA’s case is that by virtue of the six instances of Mr Azima’s misconduct

summarised at paragraph 166 above the Good Faith Representation in the

Settlement Agreement was false, in that Mr Azima had not at all times acted in

good faith and with the utmost professional integrity in his dealings with RAKIA

or other RAK entities and that Mr Azima must have known about his own

misconduct.

237. Based on my conclusion that, of the six instances of misconduct, four have been

proved as alleged, I am satisfied that the Good Faith Representation was false to Mr

Azima’s knowledge.

238. The remaining two allegations, concerning the planning media campaign and the

negotiations for the Proposed ISR JV, were proved in part. Mr Azima contends that

his conduct in relation to those two matters, even if proved as alleged, would not

have constituted misconduct such as to falsify the Good Faith Representation.

Though not necessary for the purposes of my decision, I address these contentions

briefly below.

239. With regard to the media campaign, Mr Azima contends as follows:

78

239.1 conduct directed at RAK or the Ruler would not be contrary to the

representation that Mr Azima had acted in good faith and with professional

integrity towards RAKIA, RAK Airways, and other “RAK entities”. Even

on RAKIA’s case, the media campaign would only affect the standing of

RAK and the Ruler, and the reputation of its lawyers, Dechert;

239.2 efforts to investigate and expose unlawful detention practices should not be

regarded as misconduct contrary to a duty of good faith unless those efforts

are carried out without any basis for believing that there were grounds for

concern in that regard.

240. I do not accept these contentions. It seems to me that the media campaign, although

not aimed primarily at RAKIA or any RAK entity, would, if successful, have been

likely to deter foreigners from doing business in RAK and thereby harmed the

interests of RAK commercial entities. The activities contemplated by the Security

Assessment are not fairly characterised as “efforts to investigate and expose unlawful

detention practices.” The activities included the use of “Scams, fraud and deceptive

partnerships”, and to “ensconc[e] known criminals…such as Latin American drug

cartel figures, in official RAK development or business deals”, in order to “lead RAK

authorities to lose large sums of money”, and by plotting to “Orchestrat[e] business

deals with disreputable individuals” in order to provide a factual basis for stories

about “money laundering in the RAK, tax evasion and even terrorist financing”. Mr

Azima’s involvement in the Security Assessment was such that, as he must have

known, he had not acted in good faith.

241. Mr Azima contends that the conduct alleged as regards the ISR JV, even if proved,

was not contrary to the Good Faith Representation on the ground that it is common

for misunderstandings, ambiguities or inaccuracies to arise in the course of the

discussions which later fall away as the discussions continue. In my view, Mr

Azima’s misconduct cannot be excused on this basis. The misrepresentations which

I have found were made were not in good faith and were intended to result in GDS

making a dishonest profit.

242. I therefore conclude that RAKIA has established that, as Mr Azima must have known,

the Good Faith Representation was false.

(4) Did RAKIA rely on the Good Faith Representation?

243. In support of its case that RAKIA relied on the Good Faith Representation, RAKIA

submits as follows:

243.1 To establish inducement, it is not necessary to establish that RAKIA had a

positive belief that the representation was true. Rather, it is simply necessary

to establish that the representation influenced RAKIA to act to its detriment.

243.2 Mr Azima’s assertion that the inducement requirement is not made out because

RAKIA entered into the Settlement Agreement “for purposes unconnected to

79

the settlement of the claim” and because it had reached an “internal

evaluation…that Mr Azima was acting against RAKIA, and fraudulently” is

incorrect.

243.3 Clause 3.2 of the Settlement Agreement expressly records that the payment of

$2.6 million to Mr Azima was “made in reliance on” the Good Faith

Representation. Clause 3.2 therefore provides a contemporaneous record

(which Mr Azima acknowledged and endorsed by signing the Settlement

Agreement) of RAKIA’s reliance upon that representation.

243.4 This is consistent with the evidence of Mr Buchanan, who was responsible for

signing the Settlement Agreement on behalf of RAKIA. He explains in his

witness statement that: “Prior to the execution of the Settlement Agreement…I

was aware of allegations having been made against Mr Azima and concerns

expressed about his conduct… However, had I known what I know now

insofar as concerns Mr Azima’s wrongdoings towards RAKIA, there is no way

I would have agreed to recommend that he be paid $2.6 million. However at

the time, I was reassured by his willingness ultimately to agree the wording at

clause 3.2 of the Settlement Agreement.”

244. The evidence establishes that both Mr Buchanan and the Ruler relied on the Good

Faith Representation. Whilst the Ruler and Mr Buchanan may have harboured

suspicions about Mr Azima, it does not follow that they did not rely on the Good

Faith Representation. The fact that a representee harboured suspicions regarding the

honesty of a representor does not negate inducement (see Zurich Insurance Co plc

v Hayward [2017] AC 142 at [18]-[20] (Lord Clarke) and [67]-[71] (Lord

Toulson)).

245. The Ruler stated that as far he was concerned the purpose of the Settlement

Agreement was to settle the claims brought by Mr Azima and to obtain assurance

from him that he had acted in good faith towards RAKIA and RAK more generally.

It is implicit in this statement that the Ruler relied on the Good Faith Representation.

For reasons set out later in this judgment, I reject Mr Azima’s case that RAKIA

knew about the contents of the hacked material and were inducing Mr Azima to

enter the Settlement Agreement as a trap.

(5) Loss

246. The damage sustained by RAKIA as the result of its reliance on the Good Faith

Representation is the sum of $2.6 million paid pursuant to the Settlement

Agreement.

80

The Unlawful Means Conspiracy Claim

247. RAKIA’s case is that Mr Azima’s actions in connection with the intended sale of the

Hotel gave rise to a further cause of action, namely the tort of unlawful means

conspiracy. It contends that:

247.1 Mr Azima conspired with others including Dr Massaad, Mr Adams, and Mr

Al Sadeq, to procure the illicit payments totalling $1,562,500 from RAKIA

and to conceal that misappropriation by fraudulently creating the sham

Referral Agreement.

247.2 As a result of that conspiracy, RAKIA was unlawfully deprived of $1,562,500.

247.3 Mr Azima is liable to RAKIA for the tort of unlawful means conspiracy and

is required to compensate RAKIA for the losses it suffered as a result.

248. Mr Azima’s response, apart from denying the alleged misconduct, is that the

conspiracy claim fails on the ground that illicit payments preceded the creation of the

Referral Agreement. The Referral Agreement was drafted many months after the

illicit payments were made but that is not a valid objection to the claim. RAKIA’s

case is not that the Referral Agreement caused the illicit payments to be made but

that it is evidence of the earlier conspiracy which was causative of the illicit

payments.

249. In my view, it is to be inferred from the fact that Dr Massaad received a bribe out of

the illicit payments (paragraphs 182 – 185 above), and from the involvement of Mr

Sadeq in the retrospective drafting of the Referral Agreement (paragraphs 180.2 to

180.17 above) that Mr Azima had agreed at least with Dr Massaad and probably with

Mr Al Sadeq as well that the illicit payments would be made.

250. It follows that Mr Azima is liable to pay the sum of $1,562,500 to RAKIA by way of

damages.

Mr Azima’s Hacking Claim

251. There is no dispute that RAKIA’s case against Mr Azima is based on evidence

obtained as a result of the hacking of Mr Azima’s confidential emails. Mr Buchanan

said that until September 2016, when the hacked material came to light, he had not

thought of Mr Azima as implicated in Dr Massaad’s frauds. He then changed his

mind after seeing the hacked material. Mr Azima’s case is that the hacking was

carried out by RAKIA. RAKIA denies any involvement in the hacking and claims to

have obtained the data from publicly available sources innocently.

252. Mr Azima submits that, if the Court concludes that RAKIA hacked Mr Azima’s

emails, it should strike out RAKIA’s claim as an abuse of process on the basis that its

process is being used by RAKIA in a manner that would bring the administration of

justice into disrepute. In Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police

81

[1982] AC 529 Lord Diplock held as follows:

“This is a case about the inherent power which any court of justice must

possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not

inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would

nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would

otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-

thinking people. The circumstances in which abuse of process can arise are

very varied. … It would, in my view, be most unwise if this House were to

use this occasion to say anything that might be taken as limiting to fixed

categories the kinds of circumstances in which the court has a duty (I

disavow the word discretion) to exercise this salutary power.”

253. More recent authority has confirmed that the Court has power to strike out a claim

which would be an abuse of the Court’s process. In Summers v Fairclough Homes

[2012] 1 WLR 2004, Lord Clarke held as follows:

“The language of the CPR supports the existence of a jurisdiction to strike

a claim out for abuse of process even where to do so would defeat a

substantive claim. The express words of CPR r 3.4(2)(b) give the court

power to strike out a statement of case on the ground that it is an abuse of

the court's process. It is common ground that deliberately to make a false

claim and to adduce false evidence is an abuse of process…“

254. In addition, CPR 32.1 confers on the Court the power to exclude evidence which

would otherwise be admissible to be exercised in light of the overriding objective.

The exercise of the discretion involves balancing, on the one hand, the public

interest in doing justice on the basis of all available evidence and, on the other hand,

the public interest in deterring breaches of the law entailed in the collection of the

evidence, taking into account all relevant circumstances. As the Court of Appeal

explained in Jones v University of Warwick [2003] EWCA Civ 151 [2003] 1 WLR

954 in which evidence had been obtained unlawfully and in breach of the

claimant’s right to privacy (para 28):

“That leaves the issue as to how the court should exercise its discretion in

the difficult situation confronting the district judge and Judge Harris. The

court must try to give effect to what are here the two conflicting public

interests. The weight to be attached to each will vary according to the

circumstances. The significance of the evidence will differ as will the

gravity of the breach of article 8, according to the facts of the particular case.

The decision will depend on all the circumstances.”

Mr Azima’s pleaded case

82

255. Mr Azima’s pleaded case in support of his hacking claim (at paragraph 8J of the Re-

Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim) is as follows.

“(a) Between autumn 2015 and July 2016 Mr Azima was assisting in the mediation

of a dispute between RAKIA and Dr Massaad.

(b) To the best of Mr Azima’s knowledge, on or around 14 October 2015 Mr Azima

received several emails containing malicious internet links which were aimed

at him specifically so as to induce him to open the emails. The opening of the

emails and the links in them enabled those carrying out the hacking to gain

unauthorised access to and steal Mr Azima’s confidential data.

(c) RAKIA has targeted Mr Azima in the context of its dispute with Dr Massaad.

In particular, in around April 2015, the Ruler told Mr Buchanan that he wanted

Mr Buchanan and other assistants to "target" Mr Azima. The Ruler directed his

associates to bring "charges" against Mr Azima and also to pursue "other

channels" for taking action against Mr Azima. The Ruler's associates discussed

meeting to "coordinate our attack" on Mr Azima and Dr Massaad. In or around

July 2015, the Ruler instructed another of his assistants, Mr Bustami, to "go

after" Mr Azima. Further, in the context of his role in assisting in the mediation

of the dispute between RAKIA and Dr Massaad, Mr Azima had meetings and

discussions with RAKIA's representative, Mr Buchanan, and its counsel, Mr

Neil Gerrard, of Dechert LLP. At a meeting on or about 23 July 2016, Mr

Gerrard told Mr Azima that if Dr Massaad would not agree to a settlement, Mr

Azima would be made "collateral damage" in a war that RAKIA would then

wage on Dr Massaad. Mr Azima understood this statement to be a threat.

(d) The dispute between RAKIA and Dr Massaad was not resolved. RAKIA

engaged investigators and public relations consultants (including the now

defunct firm, Bell Pottinger) to make inquiries into Mr Azima and to

disseminate information about him.

(e) On around 29 July 2016, Mr Azima learned of a website making allegations

against Dr Massaad, similar to those which RAKIA had made in the course of

the mediation of its dispute with Dr Massaad. Shortly thereafter, Mr Azima

learned of two other websites containing similar allegations against him. The

websites contained links to BitTorrent internet sites, where certain materials

stolen from Mr Azima were available to download with appropriate software

and expertise. At this point, Mr Azima apprehended that his emails and data had

been stolen, and so changed his passwords and increased his computer security.

(f) RAKIA has admitted that it and its lawyers, Dechert LLP, hold a substantial

quantity of the data stolen from Mr Azima, including an admission made in

September 2016 to holding around 30GB of material. RAKIA denies

responsibility for the hacking and theft of data or awareness of the persons

responsible. Its explanation for holding these materials, given through its

solicitor Mr David Hughes, is that the materials were obtained from internet

sites. In proceedings brought by Mr Azima against RAKIA in the United States

83

District Court complaining of the hacking, RAKIA appointed a computing

expert. That expert was not able to access the majority of the material hacked

from Mr Azima from the internet, and could obtain only a portion of Mr Azima's

material, substantially less than 30GB. RAKIA's own computing expert was

therefore unable to replicate the process by which RAKIA (through its counsel)

claims to have obtained the stolen data.

(g) Mr Azima has through his Counsel alleged RAKIA's responsibility for the

hacking of his data and has quoted in support of this allegation the inability of

RAKIA's expert in the US proceedings to access the majority of the stolen

material. Following Mr Azima making this complaint, further links to materials

stolen from Mr Azima (additional to those limited materials that RAKIA’s

expert had been able to access) appeared on several internet sites.

(h) Mr Azima avers that, to the extent his stolen data has been made available on

the internet (and websites and links have been created to facilitate access to

those data), this has been done by RAKIA and/or those acting at RAKIA's

direction, to cause damage to Mr Azima, to provide a pretext for RAKIA to

have possession of the data, or for other improper purposes.

(i) The materials that have more recently been made available as described in

paragraph (g) above do not include certain documents that had been among Mr

Azima's data. Mr Azima infers that the persons responsible for publishing the

materials on the BitTorrent sites decided to withhold these specific materials

for their own reasons. The materials withheld are damaging to RAK's

reputation. They include:

(i) emails concerning an article originally published in October 2009 on a

website, TheSmokingGun.com ("TSG"), which reported on the arrest of

the Ruler of RAK for sexual assault in a hotel in Minnesota. On 31 July

2018, TSG reported that a denial of service cyber-attack seeking to

overwhelm its servers had been made, targeting this specific article with

the apparent purpose of seeking to make it unavailable to legitimate

visitors. TSG also reported that representatives of the Ruler had

previously requested it to remove the article from its website, which it had

declined to do; and

(ii) an article critical of RAK and describing it as a rogue state within the

UAE, commissioned by the Ruler's brother, apparently in connection with

a power struggle in the RAK ruling family.”

256. Thus, Mr Azima’s pleaded case in support of his hacking claim relies on the

following six main contentions:

256.1 that RAKIA “targeted” him in the context of its dispute with Dr Massaad.

Particular reliance is placed on internal emails sent in April and July 2015;

84

256.2 that his data was accessed as a result of his opening “phishing emails” on or

around 14 October 2015;

256.3 that in July 2016 Mr Gerrard threatened that Mr Azima would be made

“collateral damage” if Dr Massaad would not agree a settlement. A settlement

was not agreed;

256.4 shortly afterwards, RAKIA engaged investigators and public relations

consultants (including Bell Pottinger) to make inquiries into Mr Azima and

disseminate information about him. The consultants engaged by RAKIA

created two websites containing publicly available information about Dr

Massaad’s perfidy which went live just a short while before Mr Azima’s hacked

documents were published on the internet;

256.5 RAKIA’s expert in the US was not able to obtain access to the majority of the

material hacked from Mr Azima and was therefore unable to replicate the

process by which RAKIA claims to have accessed the material. Following that

complaint further links appeared;

256.6 that the materials which have been made available do not contain documents

damaging to RAK’s reputation.

257. Mr Azima’s hacking claim was supplemented in the course of the hearing by the

following additional allegations:

257.1 That RAKIA’s motivation for pursuing Mr Azima was to seek “retribution for

his refusal to join RAKIA’s side” in its dispute with Dr Massaad and to

“punish him for his involvement in investigating human rights abuses in

RAK”.

257.2 By March 2015 the Ruler had come to believe that Dr Massaad was working

to destabilise his regime. The Project Update (which did not feature anywhere

in the statements of case) is said to have led the Ruler to believe that Mr Azima

was an accomplice of Dr Massaad heading the “US Team” and involved in a

critical press campaign. This enraged the Ruler and led him to demand the

targeting of Mr Azima, and the hacking of his emails.

257.3 RAKIA put together a well-armed team with the capability of carrying out the

hacking and publication online, including Mr Page who had been repeatedly

connected with hacking in other cases and who had connections to Israeli

operatives formerly of that country’s intelligence services who facilitated the

hacking.

257.4 In October and November 2015, acting on the instruction of the Ruler, Mr Page

caused or procured the hacking of Mr Azima’s emails through spear-phishing

attacks on his data.

85

257.5 RAKIA was able to gather information about Mr Azima from the hacked

material by December 2015, as evidenced by the View from the Window

document;

257.6 Although Mr Azima had (on his case) a genuine entitlement to receive $2.6

million in compensation from RAKIA in respect of the Training Academy JV,

the Settlement Agreement was in fact a device which was intended to equip

RAKIA with a legal mechanism to bring a claim against Mr Azima on the basis

of material which it already had from hacking his emails. The $2.6 million was

paid to “lure” Mr Azima into an agreement, to “reel him in and use him in our

negotiation with Dr Massaad”.

257.7 RAKIA’s case as to how it came across the hacked material innocently was

untrue and designed to conceal RAKIA’s role in the hacking.

Contemporaneous emails which show that RAKIA innocently discovered the

hacked material were in fact a false “paper trail” created by Mr Buchanan and

Mr Gerrard in order to conceal their involvement in the hacking.

257.8 Wrongdoing can be inferred from RAKIA’s “highly suspicious” approach to

the documentary evidence.

258. RAKIA’s position is, in summary, as follows.

258.1 The hacking claim is unfounded. RAKIA had no involvement whatever in the

hacking of Mr Azima’s emails/devices or in the publication of any hacked

documents online. These were documents which were publicly available on

the internet which were discovered by individuals who reported them to

RAKIA in early August 2016 at about the same time as the documents were

discovered by individuals acting on behalf of Mr Azima.

258.2 An allegation that a party engaged in a criminal conspiracy to unlawfully hack

into and publish a person’s confidential data in pursuit of a malicious

vendetta, and then took extensive steps to deliberately and dishonestly conceal

that criminal activity from the Court, is an allegation of the utmost seriousness.

It is trite law that cogent evidence is required to justify a finding of

discreditable conduct and that “the cogency of the evidence relied upon must

be commensurate with the seriousness of the conduct alleged”.

258.3 These principles required Mr Azima to adduce particularly cogent and

persuasive evidence in order to make good his hacking claim. Mr Azima’s

hacking claim necessarily entails not only a claim that RAKIA dishonestly

obtained access to his emails but that its witnesses including Mr Buchanan,

the Ruler, Mr Gerrard, Mr Halabi, Mr Bustami and Mr Handjani were parties

to a conspiracy to deceive the court by the presentation of a fundamentally

false case concerning RAKIA’s role in the hacking of Mr Azima’s emails.

258.4 In any event, whatever the position about RAKIA’s direct or indirect

involvement in hacking, the public interest in the fair and just disposal of the

86

action on the basis of the best available evidence prevails and the Court should

take these documents into account in any event.

The Facts

259. The facts relating to the hacking claim are as follows.

(1) Mr Page and the Project Update

260. Mr Page’s initial engagement in RAK was between 2008 and 2010 when he

undertook surveillance work on the behalf of the Ruler who was at the time the

Crown Prince. His remit was to try to ascertain through surveillance what plans

Sheikh Khalid, the Ruler’s brother, had to try to destabilise the Crown Prince’s

position.

261. In January 2015, at the instigation of the Ruler, a meeting took place between Mr

Page and Mr Buchanan. This was a “get to know you” meeting and no specific

mandate was discussed.

262. A few days later, a meeting took place between the Ruler and Mr Page at which the

Ruler asked Mr Page to investigate a rumour that Dr Massaad was working with a

member of the royal family to the detriment of the Ruler and the government of

RAK.

263. Subsequently, in or about March 2015, a second meeting took place between Mr

Buchanan and Mr Page at which Mr Buchanan told Mr Page that he was involved

in investigating wrongdoing by Dr Massaad and the misappropriation of assets. He

wanted Mr Page’s assistance in tracing assets, investigating Dr Massaad's

involvement with Iran, his links to Hezbollah and Lebanon and his relationship with

Viktor Bout (who was serving a sentence in the US for arms trafficking).

264. Thereafter Mr Page had regular monthly meetings with the Ruler and Mr Buchanan.

Sometimes his meetings were with the Ruler alone. Mr Page said that the Ruler “had

a habit of compartmentalising things. He would ask me to do certain things, but not

involve Jamie Buchanan. So, therefore, I had this Chinese wall between what His

Highness wishes me to undertake and what he wishes Mr Buchanan to understand.”

265. Mr Page made no reference to any written reports in his witness statement, asserting

that he does not keep contemporaneous documents “…and my briefings to clients

are invariably oral, especially in the Middle East where this is very normal.” The

implication that Mr Page did not give written briefings was untrue. In fact, as Mr

Page accepted in cross-examination, he regularly provided the Ruler with written

update reports to accompany his oral briefings. By the beginning of 2020, Mr Page

had provided some thirty update reports, all of which were in the same format. Mr

Page was unable satisfactorily to explain his reference to his briefings being

“invariably oral” which he accepted was misleading. Mr Page referred to the five

87

years’ lapse of time and to extraordinarily difficult family issues affecting his

recollection of dates and events. I do not regard these factors as a satisfactory

explanation.

266. Only one of Mr Page’s written reports was in evidence, namely the Project Update

dated 26 March 2015. The evidence of Mr Buchanan and Mr Page was that RAKIA

did not keep copies of the other reports because of a “protocol” agreed with Mr Page

whereby copies of reports would be returned to Mr Page two weeks after they were

produced. The reason why a copy of the Project Update is still available is that Mr

Buchanan inadvertently breached the protocol by arranging for the Project Update

to be emailed from his office to his private MSN email account so that he could

read it at home; the email copy has survived. Prior to the hearing Mr Azima was

unaware that the Project Update was provided by Mr Page. The fact that it was

provided by Mr Page emerged early in Mr Buchanan’s cross-examination.

267. Much of the Project Update was redacted on the ground of irrelevance but it

included the following unredacted passages relating to Mr Azima:

“In the US, KM's hired a team of advisors managed by Farhad Azima (FA) in

order to spread allegations against our client. The main allegations against the

client are on human rights issues and in particular the allegation that RAK uses

a dedicated facility in RAK where it imprisons and torture political opponents.

FA, who might also be responsible for paying the US team, handles all KM's

activities in the US. KM’s lawyer in the US, Kirby D. Behre, hired a consultant,

who is a former WSJ reporter, named Christopher Cooper, who due to his good

contacts. Cooper approached a British reporter named Simon Goodly of The

Guardian and briefed him on the RAK torture allegations, in order to raise

public opinion against RAK and to harness international civil rights

organizations to the subject.

According to our source, FA also hired a private investigator from Northern

Virginia name ‘Joseph Aboud', an American - Egyptian who seems to have

SIGINT capabilities, and probably managed to get access to the client’s Email

traffic. We couldn't verify until now the identity and capabilities of Aboud, but

we are working on it.

Our sources have reported that KM’s team suspects that they have an

information leak since they noticed some of RAK's actions in the last few

months. They believe that the client is having someone monitor their activities

either electronically or in other methods.

KM efforts against the client

FA and the US Advisory Team

In continuation to our previous report, we were informed by several new sources

that FA is managing KM's efforts in the US and perhaps even paying their bills.

At the moment, KM's strategy in the US is to spread human rights violations

allegations against the client. In particular the allegations focus on the notion

that RAK uses a dedicated facility in RAK where it imprisons and torture

political opponents. According to KM, the main figure assisting our client to

88

cover this alleged activity is Niel [sic] Gerard, a partner in Dechert LLP

(London) law firm.

Additionally, KM claims that the reach of RAK's No. 1 is also away from RAK,

claiming that the client recently got a Jon Doe locked up in the Republic of

Georgia upon his request.

Summary. Conclusion and Queries

As we reported above, KM's US team has a certain plan to smear RAK and its

ruler with human rights allegations. As far as we know, at this point, they do

not have any evidence to back up these allegations, but they started gathering

information for a campaign, based on hearsay and testimonies, and started

searching for a platform to make it public. The campaign is not public yet, so

we will be able to gather intelligence on their progress in order to monitor their

activities and attempt to contain or ruin their plans.”

268. The Project Update shows that the activities of Mr Azima, as an associate of Dr

Massaad with responsibility for managing a team of US advisors, were being

monitored although Mr Azima was not the initial or main target of RAKIA’s

investigation. Mr Page’s evidence was as follows:

“--Farhad Azima's name came out -- completely out of the blue. It was not part

of our mandate to look at Farhad Azima. This information came from a

confidential source. The confidential source was not even given --because we

weren't instructed to look at Farhad Azima He provided what he heard in the

marketplace, if that's the expression, my Lord.”

269. Mr Page’s evidence in cross-examination was that his reports were drawn up by

Insight, an Israeli company whose staff are former Israeli intelligence operatives:

“Q. And what do they specialise in?

A. Well, the founder of the company is the former head of the Lebanese desk

of Shin Bet and Shin Bet is the Israeli equivalent of MI5.

Q. Right.

A. So they specialise in collating information, particularly in the Middle East.

They obviously specialise in collating information on Iran, on Hezbollah, on

Lebanon, and they were the – the expression I use, my Lord, is the "think tank".

Q. So would it be fair to say, Mr Page, that in relation to the matters covered by

your project updates, you had in fact subcontracted at least some of that work

to this Israeli company called Insight?

A. That is correct.

Q. And they were, amongst other things, intelligence-gathering specialists?

A. They were specialists at obtaining information from confidential sources

and, my Lord, the important thing was to analyse a significant amount of data

being recovered from multiple jurisdictions and cross-referencing it, seeing

really how it related to Khater Massaad and his links. So, in answer, my short

answer is, yes, they were the conduit to receive all the information from my

other subcontractors.

…

89

Q. And they were really -- they were the people, were they, who you enlisted to

carry out some of this electronic data-gathering?

A. By which you mean electronic -- I don't understand. By "electronic", you

mean open source information on the internet?

Q. I mean of any source.

A. Well, they were -- yes, they were using the dark web, open source

information on the internet.”

270. Mr Page also explained that whether or not one of his sources breached legal

obligations in providing information was “not for [Mr Page] to consider”:

“Q. In other words, this aggrieved employee would have told you confidential

things that he'd learnt when he was working as a security officer for Sheikh

Khalid? A. Yes, and it's not for me to question whether he was in breach of any

of his employment obligations.

Q. Or for you to question whether he was breaching any duty of confidentiality

presumably, Mr Page?

A: It's -- that was not for me to consider.”

271. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Azima that RAKIA’s witnesses (Mr Buchanan,

Mr Gerrard and the Ruler) deliberately minimised Mr Page’s involvement and the

importance of the Project Update in their witness statements. I consider that there

was some substance to this criticism.

272. Mr Buchanan did not mention the Project Update in his witness statement even

though he accepted in cross-examination that it was an important document. His

explanation for this omission was that when he prepared his witness statement he

did not believe that the Project Update had come from Mr Page but had come from

some organisation which was introduced to him (Mr Buchanan) briefly but which

he advised the Ruler against using. He said that in the month prior to the hearing it

became clear to him what the source of the document was, at which point he advised

RAKIA’s solicitors. This was an unconvincing explanation. It must have been at all

times obvious to Mr Buchanan that the Project Update was the work of Mr Page,

from its content and format, from the fact that he had briefed the Ruler on it and

shown it to Mr Gerrard and from the unusual circumstances in which a copy of it

was retained by him in breach of Mr Page’s protocol. Mr Buchanan’s witness

statement said nothing about his dealings with Mr Page in 2015.

273. Mr Gerrard did not mention the Project Update in his witness statement either. His

witness statement gives the impression that the first time he came across Mr Page

was in August 2016 at the time of the discovery of the hacked material. It transpired

in the course of his cross-examination that Mr Gerrard was aware of Mr Page’s work

in 2015 and that he was shown the Project Update report in March 2015 when he

discussed it with Mr Page. The Project Update was of concern to him because it

dealt with the involvement of Simon Goodley, the Guardian journalist, who Mr

Gerrard knew was taking a significant interest in RAK related human rights issues

and phoning witnesses and junior lawyers on the case.

90

274. Mr Azima criticised the assertion in the Ruler’s witness statement that he “never

saw” the Project Update as being outright false. Based on Mr Page’s account of the

primarily oral briefings of the Ruler, I consider that it is possible that the Ruler had

no recollection of seeing the Project Update. It is, however, notable that the Ruler

was less forthcoming about the Project Update than he might have been. Mr

Azima had suggested in his first witness statement that the Project Update had led

the Ruler to target him, pointing out that the author of the Project Update was

“unknown” but that the report had “presumably been produced by or for RAKIA

and/or other RAK entities and seen by the Sheikh”. When he came to respond to

this part of Mr Azima’s witness statement, the Ruler must have known who

produced the report and on whose instructions, even if he did not recollect seeing it,

but he did not provide this information and simply dismissed the paragraph in Mr

Azima’s witness as erroneous speculation: “This is incorrect. I never saw the

report”.

275. RAKIA’s response to the criticism that the Project Update had not been dealt with

more extensively in the witness statements was that it was not a document referred

to in Mr Azima’s statements of case; the fact that RAKIA had disclosed the Project

Document showed that it was not intent on concealing it or Mr Page’s involvement

in its production which was likely to emerge at the hearing. Had RAKIA or Mr

Buchanan set out to conceal the authorship of the document, Mr Buchanan would

not have voluntarily divulged its authorship to RAKIA’s solicitors or the Court. If

Mr Azima’s theory of deliberate concealment were correct, there would be no

conceivable advantage to RAKIA of divulging this information at trial.

276. I do not regard this as a satisfactory explanation, given what I consider to be the

clear relevance of the document to the hacking claim (in that it evidences the fact

that Mr Azima was the subject of covert surveillance in 2015 being carried out under

the supervision of Mr Page who, on RAKIA’s own case, was subsequently

responsible for finding the hacked material) and the witnesses’ accounts in cross-

examination as to the importance of the document. I recognise nevertheless that the

failure to deal more fully with the Project Update may simply be explained on the

basis that it was an unhelpful document that was not referred to in Mr Azima’s

statements of case rather than on the basis that it was part of a plot to put forward a

false case about RAKIA’s role in the hacking. I accept that, if there had been such

a plot, it is surprising that the Project Update was disclosed.

277. Mr Azima also criticised the assertion in Mr Page’s witness statement (under the

heading “Knowledge of Farhad Azima”) where he said that he did not come across

the name Farhad Azima in 2015 and that the first time he came across his name was

in early 2016 at one of his regular catch up meetings with Mr Buchanan. When it

was pointed out to him that the Project Update showed that he knew of Mr Azima a

year earlier, so that his evidence was plainly wrong, Mr Page’s response was that

Mr Azima was just a side issue in the report which covered matters across the globe

involving many countries and people.

278. Although I accept that Mr Azima was only one of a large number of characters who

were the subject of his investigation, the April and July 2015 emails show that,

91

following the Project Update, the Ruler was concerned about Mr Azima and

interested in pursuing him. The Ruler said in his witness statement that in early 2015

he wanted information about Dr Massaad’s organised criminal scheme and, in

particular, as to the role Mr Azima had played. It seems most unlikely that he did

not discuss Mr Azima with Mr Page, the investigator with whom he was having

monthly meetings, in which case it is hard to believe that Mr Page could have

completely forgotten about any mention of Mr Azima prior to his meeting with Mr

Buchanan in early 2016.

(2) The April and July 2015 emails

279. On 4 April 2015, Mr Buchanan emailed Mr Handjani as follows:

“HHSS [i.e. the Ruler] had wanted us to target FA [i.e. Mr Azima] – on what basis

would we do this?”

280. It is unclear precisely what prompted this email. Mr Handjani’s evidence, which I

accept, was that Mr Azima had called him out of the blue in March 2015 and said

that there was a big problem between him and the Ruler in that he was owed $8m

by RAK and that, if things were not resolved, they could “get ugly” for everyone.

Mr Handjani was also called by Dr Massaad at about this time who asked him to

talk to the Ruler and get the Ruler to stop investigating him. Mr Handjani then spoke

to the Ruler about both calls.

281. Mr Buchanan’s evidence was that the Ruler’s instruction to target Mr Azima in April

2015 was prompted in part by Mr Azima’s claim for $8 million, which the Ruler

considered to be unfounded, and in part by the information in the Project Update.

He said that the reference to “targeting” was a reference to the bringing of criminal

charges.

282. The Ruler’s own evidence as to his state of mind was that he wanted information

about the extent of the criminal scheme organised by Dr Massaad and, in particular,

as to the role Mr Azima had played and, if he was involved in those schemes, to

have criminal charges brought against him. He dismissed the suggestion that the

emails were prompted by the Project Update.

283. The email of 4 April 2015 led to the following exchanges on the same day:

(a) Mr Handjani: “I’m not sure that’s possible at the moment. I don’t know what

basis you would target him. Thoughts?”.

(b) Mr Bustami: “As for Farhad, I would say get AH [Mr Handjani] on the case to

check with the boss on what exactly he wants done”.

(c) Mr Buchanan: “AH has no idea how we might go after him”

(d) Mr Bustami: “I think next week Amir is in town so we can both hook up with

him and brain storm it.”

284. Later that day, Mr Bustami wrote to Mr Handjani and Mr Buchanan as follows:

92

“I have had few discussions with boss about FA [Mr Azima] and he is adamant

that we bring charges against him. He was very happy that you told him that FA

is no longer asking for the $8 m.

The boss told me that you have checked with your people and confirmed back to

him that the boys with the hotel are no issue now and we should not be

intimidated by them and that FA may not be orchestrating this.

He wants me to get you on the case to file some sort of charges against Farhad.

He also told me today that you have another channel that you are using with

khater [Dr Massaad]. When are you next in town so that me you and Jamie [Mr

Buchanan] could hook up and coordinate our attack?”

285. Mr Handjani’s evidence, which I accept, was that the reference to “going through

another channel” was a reference to attempts that were going on at that time to open

a dialogue with Dr Massaad.

286. On 6 April 2015 Mr Handjani wrote to Mr Bustami and Mr Buchanan as

follows:

“Subject: Re Farhad Azima

Dear Naser

Thank you for your email. I spoke to the boss and advised him against both using

other channels and pressing charges against Farhad for now. I believe both

approaches could undermine the work that you and Jamie are doing. I was very

clear with him that we should speak with one voice-and for the moment you and

Jamie are that voice.

We have to see how Khatter responds with his lawyer. If we start pressing

charges with Farhad it would disrupt this process. My humble opinion is that we

should not be fighting multiple fires at one time.

We need to keep this circle of information tight and give full weight and support

to you and Jamie.

I have advised boss as much as

well. Best,

AAH”

287. There is no evidence of any steps being taken against Mr Azima between April and

July 2015 and the natural inference from this email is that the Ruler was dissuaded

from taking any action for the time being. Mr Buchanan’s evidence was that Mr

Azima did not feature at all in his discussions with the Ruler in this period.

“Q. What was going on in relation to investigating Mr Azima between the

beginning of April 2015 and 19 July 2015?

A. Absolutely nothing to my knowledge.

Q. Did you have some monthly meetings with Mr Page over this time?

A. Yes, I would have done.

Q. And would there have been some reports in all likelihood, written reports?

A. Yes, written or verbal, and I can't tell you which they were.

Q. And you would have discussed those with the Ruler?

A. I would have done -- I did.

93

Q. And is it your evidence that Mr Azima didn't feature at all in any further updates

from Mr Page between the beginning of April 2015 and 19 July 2015?

A. I have no recollection of Mr Azima's name or his activities coming on to the

radar screen in that period.”

288. On 19 July 2015, Mr Buchanan wrote to Mr Handjani as follows:

“NB [Naser Bustami] says the Boss wants criminal stuff taken out of letter and to

go after FA subject to guidance from AF [Andrew Frank].

Nothing ELSE new from NB - will speak to AF tomorrow and fill you

in.”

Mr Handjani replied as follows:

“Talking to the boss now. He wants me to respond to the little guy in an email

and to coordinate with you.”

289. Mr Buchanan’s evidence about this exchange in his witness statement was that he had

received a message from Mr Bustami to the effect that the Ruler wanted criminal

allegations taken out of a letter to be sent to Dr Massaad’s lawyers. The reference “to

go after FA” was a reference to the prospect of some form of criminal proceedings or

criminal charges being brought against Mr Azima which were not in the event

pursued although in cross-examination, Mr Buchanan said that he did not know what

was meant by “going after FA”. “Guidance from AF” was a reference to guidance

being sought from Mr Andrew Frank who provided public relations assistance to

RAK in the US and whose guidance would be sought in relation to any reputational

issues that might arise as a result of criminal charges being brought against Mr Azima

as a US citizen. The reference to “the little guy” was a reference to Mr Azima. Mr

Buchanan said that the planned coordinating was to do with the HeavyLift claim for

compensation about which Mr Azima had emailed Mr Handjani on the same day (19

July 2015). Mr Bustami’s and Mr Handjani’s evidence was to the same effect. On 28

July 2015 Mr Handjani sent a response to Mr Azima explaining that there was nothing

he could do beyond putting him in touch with Mr Buchanan.

290. It is unclear what prompted the Ruler to give the indication or instruction reflected in

Mr Buchanan’s email of 19 July. Mr Buchanan was unable to explain what prompted

the Ruler to want Mr Azima to be “gone after” at this time. What is clear is that the

Ruler’s desire for action to be taken against Mr Azima had not abated since April.

The evidence of Mr Buchanan and Mr Handjani was that this desire was prompted in

part by annoyance over what the Ruler perceived was an unmeritorious claim for the

$8 million but this seems unlikely given that Mr Handjani’s email of 4 April 2015

had made clear that this claim was not being pursued. The Ruler himself does not

suggest that the $8 million claim prompted his desire to go after Mr Azima. It is more

likely that the Ruler’s hostility towards Mr Azima stemmed from his perception,

originating in the Project Update, that Mr Azima was an associate of Dr Massaad who

was threatening to cause trouble for him.

94

291. There is nothing to indicate that the Ruler was persuaded that it was a bad idea to “go

after” Mr Azima or that he changed his mind about doing so. In his witness statement

the Ruler does not deal specifically with the July email but says that “as the emails

show” he was advised not to consider criminal charges against Mr Azima and

accepted that advice. But the emails concerning criminal charges were sent in April,

not July. I infer that the Ruler continued to harbour feelings of hostility towards Mr

Azima in the period following the July email but it is unclear what, if any, hostile

action was taken.

292. There is no evidence about any guidance being sought or obtained from Mr Frank, as

mentioned in the email. There are no records of the Ruler’s discussions with Mr Page

at this time. There is no indication that any consideration was given to the hacking of

Mr Azima’s email accounts but neither is there any documentary evidence that this

was ruled out as a way of “going after” Mr Azima.

(3) The spear-phishing emails

293. There is no specific evidence that RAKIA was planning to take, or took any steps to

obtain intelligence about Mr Azima from July 2015 onwards.

294. Mr Azima’s case is that in October and November 2015, that is to say, some three to

four months after the July emails referred to above, his emails were hacked as a result

of his opening or clicking on links contained in spear-phishing emails that he received

on or around 14 October 2015. The spear-phishing emails were sophisticated and

included a malicious email purporting to be sent from Dr Massaad’s personal

assistant, Ms Beudjekian.

295. The parties’ forensic computer experts (“the Experts”) agree that Mr Azima received

several “spear phishing” emails in October and November 2015. They also agree on

the following:

295.1 there is no evidence that Mr Azima opened any of those emails or clicked on

the links within them;

295.2 there is no evidence that any of those emails (or any other emails received by

Mr Azima) led to Mr Azima’s online credentials being stolen or to any

unauthorised access to his devices;

295.3 a single spear-phishing email could be an effective means of targeting Mr

Azima;

295.4 there is no evidence that identifies the person(s) who sent the emails; based on

the information made available to them, it is not possible to determine who

was responsible for the unauthorised access to Mr Azima’s data and the

publication of that data online, how and when the unauthorised access

occurred or how much data was obtained as a result;

95

295.5 there were three tranches of data, the first 27.775 GB in size, the second of

which became available on or about 30 August 2016 with a size of

10.33MB and the third with a size of 4.43 GB;

295.6 the contents of two of the three tranches of the hacked data appear to emanate

from iCloud account(s); Mr Azima appeared to have at least two iCloud

accounts and a number of Apple devices including an iPhone but since the

iCloud logs identifying contemporary access to Mr Azima’s iCloud accounts

are not available to the Experts, the Experts agree that it is not possible to

confirm whether, and if so when, how and by whom, unauthorised access

was gained to Mr Azima’s iCloud accounts;

295.7 analysis of the access logs for Mr Azima’s fa@fa1.us account and the

connection record and recent access change record for his account

fa@farhadazima.com do not enable any conclusions to be drawn as to how,

and by whom, any unauthorised access to either of those accounts occurred;

295.8 given Mr Azima’s statements that the access to his fa@fa1.us account shown

by the logs in October 2015 was carried out without his authorisation, the

access on those dates appears to be suspicious;

295.9 suspicious activity in October 2015 does not provide determinative evidence

of when the fa@fa1.us emails contained in the Internet Data may have been

taken from Mr Azima’s account.

296. The Experts do not agree as to whether one of the five emails identified in the report

of Mr Tarbell (Mr Azima’s expert) as a spear-phishing email was a spear-phishing

email or a non-targeted phishing email; nor do they agree as to whether the spear

phishing emails indicate that Mr Azima was being targeted in a systematic campaign

by a single attacker.

297. Whilst it is not possible to say precisely how Mr Azima’s emails were accessed

without his authorisation, the indications are that it began at around the time the

spear-phishing emails were received. Mr Tarbell examined the records of instances

when Mr Azima’s email account, “fa@fa1.us” was accessed in October 2015. That

examination indicated that there were multiple instances between 13 and 15 October

2015 during which time the account was accessed from IP addresses that are

unfamiliar to Mr Azima. Mr Krone agrees that the access on these dates appears to

be suspicious.

298. Mr Tarbell also found that the emails stored in the “fa@fa1.us” account also

included a number of emails in which Mr Azima had recorded passwords for other

email accounts. The person who had covertly accessed the “fa@fa1.us” account

could therefore have obtained the means of accessing other email accounts used by

Mr Azima.

299. The “authorised connection record” for another of Mr Azima’s email addresses,

“fa@farhadazima.com”, indicates that this address was accessed from several

96

countries with which Mr Azima had no connection. Mr Krone accepts that this

access appears to be suspicious.

300. In summary, it is possible that the hacking of Mr Azima’s emails is linked to his

receipt of spear-phishing emails in October 2015 but this is not firmly corroborated

by the evidence. There is no evidence as to who carried out the hacking.

(4) The View from the Window document

301. Following the alleged hacking in October/November 2015, on 29 December 2015 a

document was prepared on RAKIA’s side which described a “series of

investigations” and labelled Mr Azima as a participant in “fraudulent activities”. It

was prepared by Andrew Frank, a senior individual at Karv Communications, a PR

company working for RAKIA, who had been mentioned in Mr Buchanan’s email of

19 July 2015. It was sent to Mr Gerrard on 4 January 2016.

302. The document reads as follows:

“View from the window

The window has opened on Ras Al Khaimah through a series of investigations

that have unearthed a massive fraud that has taken place in the Emirate, the UAE,

and several other countries including the Republic of Georgia, India, Congo and

others.

A number of things have been exposed as fact over the past twenty-four months:

-KM was the CEO of RAK Ceramics beginning in 2003, as well as the RK

Investment Authority (RAKIA) beginning in 2006 and oversaw a series of

investments inside and outside of RAK that are under now intense scrutiny and

have exposed wrong-doing

-Gila Mikadze was head of RAKIA's operations in Georgia and created and

oversaw numerous corporations that stole money from the Emirate and was used

for his own purposes and to bribe former government officials.

-Others committed crimes inside RAK, including the Ruler's Chief legal advisor

and the legal advisor to RAKIA (they also happen to be cousins(?))

… -FA, a U.S. citizen, appears to have orchestrated, if not (fully) participated in

numerous fraudulent activities.

… -Companies were set up with Iranian nationals”

303. Mr Azima’s case is that the reference in the document to “FA” (i.e. Mr Azima)

appearing “to have orchestrated, if not (fully) participated in numerous fraudulent

activities” establishes that RAKIA must by this stage have hacked into Mr Azima’s

emails because otherwise Mr Frank would not have not known about what RAKIA

alleges in these proceedings to be his “fraudulent activities”.

304. In support of this case, Mr Azima submits as follows:

304.1 It is striking that none of RAKIA’s witnesses even acknowledged the existence

of the View from the Window document. RAKIA failed to call Mr Frank

97

as a witness and failed to identify Karv when ordered by HHJ Kramer QC to

identify its public relations consultants, indicating an awareness that his

evidence would be damaging to RAKIA.

304.2 The View from the Window document establishes “beyond serious

argument” that by the end of December 2015, RAK and RAKIA had

obtained access to Mr Azima’s confidential emails and data. The author of

the document had clearly been informed that RAK and RAKIA had a firm

basis for asserting that Mr Azima had orchestrated or participated in

“numerous fraudulent activities”.

304.3 A belief on RAKIA’s part that there was such a basis could only have come

from the hacked material. As Mr Buchanan, who was leading RAKIA’s

investigation, explained, RAKIA only believed that Mr Azima had engaged in

any fraud upon reviewing the Hacked Material:

“A. The investigations that had taken place until that point gave me no

cause to believe that Mr Azima was involved in any frauds in respect of

Dr Massaad.

Q. But you changed your mind when you saw the hacked data; is that

right?

A. I changed my mind when I saw the hacked data, that is correct.”

304.4 When Mr Buchanan was shown the View from the Window document, he

claimed to be able to offer no explanation for its contents and to have been

unaware of it until it was put to him in cross-examination.

304.5 Mr Gerrard gave inconsistent explanations for the document, alleging initially

that it was “ramblings” of Mr Frank which had come “out of the blue” and

later that it was the product of a meeting which had taken place two weeks

earlier concerning a “blitzkrieg” of negative publicity. He claimed that he told

Mr Frank that the section of the View from the Window concerning Mr Azima

“isn’t going to work” because all that was known about Mr Azima was

“suspicions”.

304.6 This account is not credible given the absence of any response by Mr Gerrard

to Mr Frank’s email attaching the View from the Window document and the

inconsistency with the evidence of Mr Buchanan, according to whom the

“blitzkrieg” meeting did not take place until January 2016. Moreover, the

View from the Window does not purport to describe “suspicions”. It states that

investigations have “unearthed a massive fraud” and that the matters listed in

it (including Mr Azima’s involvement in “numerous frauds” “have been

established as fact”.

305. The View from the Window document shows that in late 2015, a negative PR

campaign was being planned against Mr Azima alongside Dr Massaad. Mr Azima

had not dropped out of the picture. It also suggests that someone had planted in Mr

Frank’s mind the idea that Mr Azima had been involved in fraudulent activities. That

98

person was probably Mr Gerrard who had briefed Mr Frank before the document was

sent. It was put to Mr Gerrard in cross-examination that, in order to have accused Mr

Azima of fraud, Mr Gerrard must have been aware of the contents of Mr Azima’s

confidential emails:

“Q. … by that stage, I suggest, Mr Gerrard, you were aware of the confidential

material that had been procured illegally from within Mr Azima's email records

in October/November 2015 and one way or another you thought you were on to

something. You started to think that you could -- that you had some material to

allege fraud. That's what I put to you.

A. So I'd like to deny that, my Lord. It's preposterous. But I'd also like to explore

that question because what you're suggesting is I had a secret little stash of Mr

Azima's documents which I could select at will to identify frauds. I mean, how

would I do that? How do I pull this stuff down? How do I search for it?”

306. Shortly thereafter, the following exchange took place:

“Q. And you would have been aware that Mr Page had been successful in

gathering intelligence from within Mr Azima's confidential email archive?

…

Q. I'm putting that to you.

A. Right. No, I wasn't aware.

Q. And that this is the only explanation for why Mr Frank has recorded, based

upon what you and Mr Buchanan must have told him, the idea that Mr Azima

had been involved in numerous fraudulent activities.

A. My Lord, that's ridiculous. Mr Frank is a clever man, but he's not a lawyer.

He will have heard on a regular basis concerns as to gun-running, fraud, etc,

etc. What he will not have grasped that we did not have sufficient evidence to

proceed. On everything else we had stacks of evidence against -- let's take the

first bullet point, Dr Massaad. We had evidence. Indeed he was prosecuted. We

had evidence against Mikadze. He was prosecuted. We had evidence of other

crimes inside RAK, including the Ruler's chief adviser and the general counsel.

They were prosecuted. Let me ditch Farhad Azima for the moment. We had

dummy corporations set up in the RAK, UK, Georgia, Cayman Islands, etc. We

could have put those in, and so on. Fraudulent bank accounts, possible gun-

running … we did not have any evidence that we could have proceeded against

of actual fraud against Farhad Azima. That is just plainly wrong and that's what

I told Andrew Frank”

307. Mr Gerrard’s explanation for the reference in the View from the Window document

to Mr Azima’s “orchestrating if not participating” in “numerous fraudulent activities”

was confused. At one point he referred to the Project Update, although this had not

alleged fraud against Mr Azima. He also referred to information provided to Mr Frank

at a meeting attended by Mr Buchanan, although this meeting did not take place until

later. His evidence was essentially that Mr Frank was told about suspicions

concerning Mr Azima but these suspicions had nothing to do with Mr Azima’s hacked

emails.

99

308. It is credible, in my view, that suspicions about Mr Azima’s involvement in fraud

had arisen because of his association with Dr Massaad rather than because access had

been obtained to Mr Azima’s confidential emails. I do not attach great significance

to Mr Buchanan’s expression of surprise at the contents of the View from the Window

document when it was shown to him in cross-examination accompanied by the

suggestion that the document revealed prior knowledge of Mr Azima’s confidential

emails.

309. In my judgment, the references to Mr Azima’s orchestrating, if not participating in,

numerous fraudulent activities in the View from the Window document are too vague

to establish that RAKIA had obtained access to Mr Azima’s confidential emails by

the time this document was prepared. Although the document lists Mr Azima’s

apparent orchestration of or participation in fraud as one of a number of established

“facts”, I agree with RAKIA’s submission that the document reads like a series of

points for a press release or article rather than a carefully sourced analysis. I do not

consider that any adverse inferences can be drawn against RAKIA from its failure to

call Mr Frank as a witness, given that Mr Azima did not refer to the View from the

Window document as part of his pleaded case.

(5) The Settlement Agreement

310. On Mr Azima’s case, RAKIA cynically entered into the Settlement Agreement as a

device to trap him into agreeing a duty of good faith and an English jurisdiction

clause, which, with its access to the hacked material, would give RAKIA leverage

over Mr Azima. It would enable RAKIA to exact retribution for Mr Azima’s failure to

take RAKIA’s side in its dispute with Dr Massaad and provide RAKIA with the

means of turning Mr Azima against Dr Massaad.

311. In support of this case, Mr Azima submits as follows:

311.1 The lack of internal documentation on RAKIA’s side to indicate that any

detailed review of the HeavyLift claim actually took place suggests that,

contrary to Mr Buchanan’s assertions, there was no investigation of the

HeavyLift claim, no internal review of the claim and no working group in

RAK gathering relevant information, auditing financials and speaking with

individuals; RAKIA was not interested in ascertaining the specific amounts

that HeavyLift had actually invested; there were no documents evidencing

such an analysis;

311.2 There is no record of any board meeting to approve the Settlement Agreement;

311.3 The letter sent to the Ruler by Mr Buchanan and Mr Bustami dated 15

February 2016 seeking the Ruler’s approval of the Settlement Agreement

indicates the importance of the obligation of good faith: “It is on this basis

that we have been able to successfully negotiate the inclusion of Clause 3.2

referred to below which we believe is the key clause in this agreement bearing

100

in mind your wider objectives.” Those objectives were to manufacture a basis

for bringing an action against Mr Azima in England as part of a campaign to

ruin his reputation and good standing;

311.4 Clause 3.2 purports to include an assurance of good faith by Mr Azima not

only towards RAKIA but also towards other entities in which the government

of RAK had a shareholding, irrespective of the place of incorporation. This is

important given that HeavyLift’s claim was against RAKIA and concerned a

joint venture entered into in 2007 with RAK Airways, which was incorporated

in RAK also. There was no need to include this reference to the place of

incorporation in clause 3.2 unless RAKIA envisaged that other RAK entities,

such as RAKIA Georgia, might be involved in some way.

312. Mr Azima’s contention that the entering into of the Settlement Agreement is

consistent with RAKIA having hacked his emails some five months previously gives

rise to an obvious objection. If, as Mr Azima alleges, RAKIA had by the end of 2015

got access to his confidential emails and discovered evidence of what it now contends

were his fraudulent activities, it is, on the face of it, inherently unlikely that RAKIA

would have been willing to enter into the Settlement Agreement or to make any

payment to Mr Azima in settlement of the HeavyLift claim. The fact that RAKIA

paid out $2.6 million to Mr Azima under the Settlement Agreement suggests that

RAKIA was unaware of the contents of the hacked material.

313. A possible answer to this objection, advanced by Mr Azima, is that entering into the

Settlement Agreement, even at a cost of $2.6 million, made commercial sense for

RAKIA because the Good Faith Representation and the jurisdiction clause, coupled

with its knowledge of the hacked material, gave RAKIA leverage over Mr Azima,

enabling RAKIA to sue, or threaten to sue Mr Azima and thereby maintain pressure

on him in the context of RAKIA’s dispute with Dr Massaad. Ultimately, if necessary,

it could sue Mr Azima to recover the $2.6 million, as it has done.

314. Mr Azima’s “leverage” explanation for the Settlement Agreement is not, however,

compelling. RAKIA did not need to enter into the Settlement Agreement in order to

sue or to threaten to sue Mr Azima on the basis of the hacked emails. It could have

sued him or threatened to sue him in relation to the fraudulent misappropriations in

connection with the intended hotel sale without Clause 3.2 (though not in an English

court). Moreover there is no evidence that RAKIA ever in fact attempted to use the

Settlement Agreement or the hacked material to exercise leverage over Mr Azima.

315. I consider that the letter of recommendation dated 15 February 2016 from Messrs

Buchanan and Bustami to the Ruler provides some support for Mr Azima’s

“leverage” explanation. It is striking that Messrs Buchanan and Mr Bustami

described Clause 3.2 (rather than the full and final settlement provision) as the key

clause in the agreement, bearing in mind the “wider objectives”. Mr Azima says that

these enigmatic words are a veiled reference to the Ruler’s objectives to pursue Mr

Azima. It is possible to read the letter in the way contended for by Mr Azima but it is

also possible to read “wider objectives” as referring to the Ruler’s objectives

concerning Dr Massaad and the benefit of getting an assurance from Mr Azima that

he was acting in good faith in the discussions with Dr Massaad. The Ruler’s evidence

101

was that an assurance from Mr Azima that he had acted properly served the wider

objectives of understanding Dr Massaad’s fraud and obtaining recompense.

316. I am not persuaded by the contention advanced on behalf of Mr Azima that there was

no meaningful investigation by RAKIA into the HeavyLift compensation claim. Mr

Buchanan’s witness statement contains an account of the attempts to obtain

information from HeavyLift’s side and the difficulties arising from the absence of

documentation. The evidence of Mr Buchanan and Mr Gerrard was that there was an

investigation by Dechert and that the documents produced by Dechert are covered by

legal professional privilege, which they would be.

317. I do not regard the absence of formal board approval of the settlement as significant. I

accept Mr Buchanan’s explanation that the Settlement Agreement went straight to the

Ruler for his approval. The scope of Clause 3.2, extending to RAK entities

irrespective of their place of incorporation, is in my view explicable as “belt and

braces” drafting rather than denoting knowledge of the hacked material.

(6) The engagement of Digitalis

318. In March 2016, RAKIA engaged (through Bell Pottinger) Digitalis to prepare a

primarily defensive strategy in order to protect the client’s reputation, as set out in

Digitalis’ engagement letter of 21 March 2016. They were also instructed to create

two websites to promote publicly available material relating to Dr Massaad and his

involvement in frauds.

319. In his skeleton agreement, Mr Azima identified Digitalis, along with Mr Page and

Bell Pottinger, as being part of a team engaged by RAKIA with a view to conducting

an aggressive internet and media campaign and with “the capability of obtaining

material through hacking”. There was, however, no basis in the evidence for the

assertion that either Bell Pottinger or Digitalis had any such capacity. The evidence of

Mr Leach, who worked for Bell Pottinger, was that Bell Pottinger prepared a media

and communications strategy that was sent to RAKIA but not in the event

implemented. Mr Azima did not feature at all as he was not someone they were

focused on.

320. The evidence of Mr King, the Chief Executive Officer of Digitalis, which I accept,

was to the effect that prior to 1 November 2016, when they were asked by Dechert to

preserve documents relating to the dispute between Mr Azima and RAKIA, they

were unfamiliar with the name of Mr Azima and undertook no work in relation to Mr

Azima. Mr Azima did not feature in their plans for an “offensive” online campaign

and was not being targeted.

321. Mr Azima submitted that the absence of relevant documents in Digitalis’s possession

was concerning. Mr King provided a full and clear explanation of his company’s

document retention policies. There was no evidence of deliberate

102

document destruction, much less of any instruction by RAKIA to destroy relevant

documents.

(7) The July 2016 meeting

322. Following execution of the Settlement Agreement in March 2016, Mr Azima

continued to engage with RAKIA with a view to brokering a settlement of its dispute

with Dr Massaad.

323. On 16 July 2016, a meeting was held between Mr Azima and three representatives of

RAKIA: Mr Buchanan, Mr Gerrard, and an associate in Mr Gerrard’s firm, Dechert,

at the Churchill Hotel in London.

324. Mr Azima’s case is that at this meeting Mr Gerrard threatened him that if Dr

Massaad would not agree to a settlement, Mr Azima would be made "collateral

damage" in a war that RAKIA would then wage on Dr Massaad, a threat that was put

into effect a few weeks later.

325. Mr Azima’s evidence was as follows:

325.1 Mr Gerrard told him to stop acting as a mediator, and instead work solely for

RAKIA to assist them in their campaign against Dr Massaad.

325.2 He refused and told Mr Gerrard that is not how he operated; this aggravated

Mr Gerrard who proceeded to reference his history, stating that he had been

a policeman, a detective, a prosecutor and a lawyer, and that he had

connections with “Number 10” and that if Mr Azima did not settle the case

with Dr Massaad then there would be a war against Dr Massaad and Mr

Azima would be “collateral damage”.

325.3 Mr Azima asked Mr Gerrard whether he was threatening him. He told Mr

Azima that this was not a “threat but a promise.”

325.4 At the end of the meeting, he asked Mr Buchanan for a copy of the

handwritten notes that Mr Gerrard's colleague had taken. Mr Buchanan

informed Mr Azima that he would be sent a copy of the notes after they were

transcribed that evening. However, after repeated chasing, Mr Buchanan said

that Mr Azima could not have them without Mr Gerrard's permission. He

also set out in an email dated 23 July 2016, in response to Mr Azima’s

complaint that what Mr Gerrard had said to him amounted to “extortion” and

“blackmail”, a dictionary definition of those terms.

326. Dechert’s note of the relevant part of the meeting reads as follows:

“NG noted that Kirby had referred to “mutually assured destruction” but that

KM was delusional if he thought that bringing the criminal and civil actions

would destroy HHSS. NG noted that HHSS was now engaging with Abu

103

Dhabi and the risk was that, the further this went, the more likely collateral

damage would occur. It would be difficult to keep the scope of RAK’s

actions within a narrow compass. NG asked FA to inform KM that Dechert

has access to the whole of the Dana Jets database, the whole RAK Ceramics

database, which included the whole of Sheba Nair’s emails. Essentially,

Dechert had all of the client’s documents and were analysing them.”

327. This note suggests that the reference to collateral damage was in response to Mr

Azima’s lawyer’s reference to the possibility of “mutually assured destruction” and

to the possibility that the greater the engagement with Abu Dhabi (i.e. the UAE

authorities) the more likely it was that collateral damage would occur. In his witness

statement, Mr Gerrard confirmed what was recorded in the note, saying that he had

wanted to convey to Mr Azima that the Ruler was already engaging with the

criminal authorities in the UAE and that, once criminal proceedings were started,

there was a greater risk of collateral damage for Dr Massaad and any of his

associates. As he put it in cross-examination: “The evidence as it was mounting was

clearly going to move, we anticipated, from fraud to more federal-type offences and

that wouldn’t be for us to determine.” He meant that once litigation is started or a

prosecutor takes over, these things get a life of their own. He was not thinking about

anything other than the usual effects of litigation or criminal proceedings.

328. In his witness statement, Mr Buchanan said as follows: “The meeting was a tense one

because it was during a critical stage of the negotiations with Dr Massaad but that Mr

Gerrard was firm, focused and professional. Mr Azima raised his voice at times, Mr

Gerrard did not. Mr Gerrard did not tell Mr Azima to stop acting as a mediator

(which was not Mr Azima's role) and work solely for RAKIA. Instead he impressed

on Mr Azima the importance of his role acting as Dr Massaad's representative in the

discussions and encouraged Mr Azima to act in Dr Massaad's best interests and do

his bit to help resolve the dispute.”

329. In their oral evidence, Mr Buchanan and Mr Gerrard denied that any demand was

made that Mr Azima “change sides”, pointing out that this would, from RAKIA’s

perspective, have been pointless. As Mr Gerrard put it:

“A. At no stage did I ask Farhad Azima -- I think you said change sides or

whatever it was. That would be faintly ridiculous. He told us many times it was

difficult enough talking to Dr Massaad without thinking he had changed sides for

RAKIA. We recognised he was in Dr Massaad's camp, that's okay, and I think he

was trying to mediate on behalf of Dr Massaad, but unfortunately, as I say, he

and we failed.”

Mr Buchanan made the same point: “We absolutely did not wish Mr Azima to take

RAKIA’s side, because that would have been disastrous in terms of the negotiations.”

330. In my judgment, it is unlikely that Mr Gerrard would have demanded that Mr Azima

cease to act as a mediator and “change sides” as this would have been an unrealistic

and potentially counter-productive demand. I consider that the note of the meeting is

probably accurate and that when referring to “collateral damage” Mr Gerrard

was

104

referring to damage to Dr Massaad and others from legal proceedings, rather than a

threat to Mr Azima.

331. I accept that Mr Azima appears to have been troubled by what passed at the meeting

and that he told Mr Buchanan that what Mr Gerrard said amounted to extortion and

blackmail (as appears from Mr Buchanan’s email of 23 July 2016). I can well believe

that Mr Gerrard conducted the meeting in a forceful and even aggressive way. At the

same time, I bear in mind that, after learning of the BitTorrent sites accessing the

hacked material, Mr Azima did not immediately perceive RAKIA and the Ruler to be

responsible for the hacking.

332. After denying that there was any extortion or blackmail, Mr Buchanan’s email of 23

July 2016 continued as follows:

“To be absolutely clear, Neil did not demand money nor anything else from you

in return for anything whatsoever. Neil has previously challenged you as to

whether you have always acted in the best interests of HH. He did so again at our

last meeting. I personally don't see the problem. You have signed an agreement

confirming that you have never acted against the interests of HH. All he did was

raised [sic] questions as to HeavyLift. In a previous meeting he asked you about

Eurasia Hotel Holdings.”

333. Mr Azima submitted as follows:

333.1 the references in the email to HeavyLift and Eurasia Hotel Holdings support

the inference that RAKIA (or at least Mr Gerrard) already had access to at

least some information taken from the hacked material;

333.2 Mr Buchanan’s explanation for the reference to “HeavyLift” (namely that it

was a reference to an inquiry that RAKIA had conducted into the ownership

of HeavyLift itself, not to the Training Academy JV) was untrue because there

was no documentary evidence to indicate that RAKIA ever raised a concern

about the ownership of HeavyLift;

333.3 Mr Gerrard’s explanation for the reference to Eurasia Hotel Holdings

(namely that RAKIA had become aware through the Panama Papers and

through a “tip off” that Mr Azima and Dr Massaad were both listed as

directors of Eurasia Hotel Holdings, and that this gave him reason for

suspicion) was untrue because there is no complaint in these proceedings that

Dr Massaad was a director of Eurasia Hotel Holdings.

334. I do not consider that the references to HeavyLift and Eurasia Hotel Holdings

necessarily support the inference that Mr Gerrard knew about the hacked material.

As with the View from the Window document, these references are insufficiently

specific to denote knowledge of the hacked material and they can be explained by

reference to other sources of information, as Mr Gerrard did. Mr Azima expressly

confirmed that no one on RAKIA’s side had threatened to use the hacked material

105

or the Settlement Agreement to force him to change sides. The note of the meeting

on 16 July 2016 makes clear that Mr Gerrard did threaten to use RAKIA’s access

to emails in the ensuing “war”, but these were emails on the Dana Jet and RAK

Ceramics databases, not Mr Azima’s.

335. It was put to Mr Buchanan in cross-examination that his failure to hand over the

notes of the meeting on 16 July 2016 to Mr Azima was because of concern that the

meeting notes evidenced threats. The disclosed meeting notes do not disclose threats

and do not support Mr Azima’s version of events. I accept Mr Buchanan’s evidence

that he did not send the notes to Mr Azima when they were first requested because

he was busy on other matters and that subsequently he was advised by Mr Gerrard

not to send them because it was felt that the negotiations with Dr Massaad had

broken down.

(8) The Massaad websites, the blogging websites and the BitTorrents

336. Following the 16 July 2016 meeting, the next day Mr Buchanan sent an email to Mr

Azima saying that he had spoken to the Ruler about a verbal settlement offer from Dr

Massaad but that if Dr Massaad failed to put forward a realistic offer in writing and a

proposal for reaching a final settlement by the “end of the ceasefire” i.e. 31 July, “we

must assume that the ceasefire has now ended”. The dispute between RAKIA and Dr

Massaad was not resolved by the end of July and at the beginning of August websites

appeared making allegations against Dr Massaad. These websites were, it is common

ground, set up by Digitalis on RAKIA’s and Bell Pottinger’s instructions. Mr Azima

and Mr Buchanan exchanged friendly emails expressing disappointment at this

outcome.

337. Within days of the websites concerning Dr Massaad appearing, a series of other

websites also appeared attacking Mr Azima. One set of websites was activated on 7

and 8 August 2016. These were blogging websites denigrating Mr Azima as a “fraud”

and a “scammer”. The author of the blogging website with the headline “Farhad

Azima Exposed Again” (the “Exposed” blog) was listed by the username of

“crimeboard”. That individual initially allowed his or her location to be shown, which

indicated that he or she was in the UAE. This may have been a blunder; the location

reporting was subsequently disabled. The blogging website with the headline

“Farhad Azima Scammer” (“the Scammer blog”) also referred to Mr Azima’s

connections with Mr Adams and Dr Massaad: “Click the link to find Azima’s

involvement with some big personality’s [sic] including his close associates like Ray

Adams & Dr. Khater Massaad.”

338. The blogging websites provided links to BitTorrent websites on which Mr Azima’s

personal data had been uploaded and/or cached. A BitTorrent website is a site from

which a computer user can access a BitTorrent network, that is to say a group of

computers using the BitTorrent protocol which enables them to share anonymously

data or “torrents” downloaded simultaneously from different computers in the group.

Over the course of August and September 2016, three caches of Mr Azima’s data

emerged, the first appearing on or about 4 August 2016, the second on or about 30

August 2016 and the third on or about 8 September 2016. The hacked data

106

included email communications up to August 2016 suggesting that the hackers had

access to Mr Azima’s email accounts throughout the period from October 2015 to

August 2016.

339. Mr Azima contends that the proximity in time between (i) the breakdown in the

negotiations with Dr Massaad and RAKIA and the consequential appearance of the

websites attacking Dr Massaad (which RAKIA admits to arranging through Digitalis)

and (ii) the websites with links to the hacked material, cannot realistically be a

coincidence but is a clear indication that the Ruler or RAKIA were behind both

attacks.

340. RAKIA contends that there is no connection between the Massaad websites and the

appearance of the blogging websites with links to the hacked material and that it is

inherently unlikely that sophisticated hackers (which is what the hackers would be, if

Mr Azima’s hacking claim were correct) acting on the instructions of RAKIA or the

Ruler, would put up the blogging websites so soon after the Massaad websites as this

would inevitably give rise to suspicion that both the blog websites and the Massaad

websites were part of the same PR campaign and hence that RAKIA had carried out

the hacking. On Mr Azima’s case, RAKIA had had access to the hacked material

since the preceding October 2015 and could have delayed publicising it for several

more weeks or months. Mr Azima’s answer to this point is that RAKIA may have

been sufficiently confident that it had covered its tracks for it not to be concerned

about detection.

341. In my judgment, if the hackers were acting on the instructions of the Ruler or RAKIA,

it is unlikely that they would have timed the publication of the hacked material to

coincide with the end of the “ceasefire” and the posting of the anti-Dr Massaad

websites. It is more probable in my view that the two incidents, while close in time,

were not in fact related. The posting of the Massaad websites was a deliberate PR

campaign instructed by the RAKIA; the other was the unrelated act of hackers.

(9) RAKIA’s alleged discovery of the hacked material

342. RAKIA has sought to explain how it became aware of the hacked material on the

internet. Mr Azima submits that RAKIA’s account is false and dishonest and is

advanced by RAKIA in order to cover up its own responsibility for the hacking.

343. RAKIA’s pleaded case, and the case it advanced in its witness statements

concerning its discovery of the hacked material, is, in summary, as follows:

343.1 Following a meeting in January 2016 with Mr Azima, Mr Buchanan was

alarmed by a warning from Mr Azima that, if RAKIA did not resolve matters

with Dr Massaad soon, there would be an aggressive and negative public

relations campaign directed against the individuals and companies involved

and the Emirate of RAK more generally.

343.2 Mr Buchanan discussed this warning with Dechert. It was decided that it

would be prudent to take steps on RAK’s behalf to prepare for any such

107

campaign, including by actively monitoring what was being published online.

As part of that preparation, Mr Buchanan discussed Mr Azima’s warning with

various advisers including Mr Page.

343.3 In around February/March 2016, Mr Buchanan met with Mr Page and asked

him to look out for anything relevant about a possible negative publicity

campaign against RAK. Following that meeting, Mr Page contacted Mr Halabi

and asked him to keep an eye out for anything interesting and unusual relating

to RAK, the Ruler, Dr Massaad and Mr Azima.

343.4 Following Mr Page’s request, Mr Halabi carried out Google searches for those

names from time to time. During one of those regular Google searches in early

August 2016, Mr Halabi discovered the blog sites containing links to a torrent

file containing information relating to Mr Azima.

343.5 Mr Halabi therefore contacted Mr Page and sent him the links to the torrent

sites. Mr Page then informed Mr Buchanan and Mr Gerrard about the links.

343.6 Mr Gerrard, in turn, contacted Mr del Rosso at Vital Management Services

(“VMS”) to seek advice on instructing a suitably qualified company to

download the materials. Mr del Rosso emailed Chris Swecker, a former

Assistant Director of the FBI and VMS’s attorney, to ask for

recommendations.

343.7 On Mr Swecker’s recommendation, VMS then contacted Mr Garcia at NTi

and engaged NTi to download the materials and to identify any other websites

containing information relevant to Mr Azima.

343.8 On 23 and 24 August 2016, Ms Gray, a senior analyst with NTi, downloaded

the contents of the files listed in the torrent file entitled “Farhad Azima of the

Aviation Leasing Group Exposed” using BitTorrent software (the “First

Tranche of the Internet Data”).

343.9 On 1 September 2016, Mr del Rosso sent an email to Mr Swecker, Mr Garcia

and Ms Gray informing them that a new dump of data relating to Mr Azima

had been discovered online. The following day Mr del Rosso sent a further

email with links to the torrent site. When she returned to the office the

following week, Ms Gray downloaded the contents of the files that were listed

in that torrent file (the “Second Tranche of the Internet Data”).

343.10 Ms Gray thereafter continued actively searching for any additional

information relating to Mr Azima. During the course of those searches on 9

September 2016 she discovered an additional dump of data relating to Mr

Azima. She then proceeded to download the contents of the files listed in that

torrent file (the “Third Tranche of the Internet Data”).

108

343.11 NTi provided copies of the First, Second and Third Tranches of the Internet

Data to Mr del Rosso. Mr del Rosso then provided those copies to RAKIA’s

lawyers at Dechert.

344. Mr Page deals in his witness statement with Mr Halabi’s involvement as follows:

344.1 Following a conversation with Mr Buchanan in early 2016 in which he had

been asked to keep his ears and eyes open for anything he heard about a

negative publicity campaign that might be damaging for RAK, Mr Page

spoke to a few contacts he uses occasionally in the investigations business,

journalism and PR industry and asked them to keep their ear to the ground.

One of those was Mr Halabi, whom he believes he met at a round table lunch

in 2012. Mr Halabi is an Israeli journalist who specialises in Middle Eastern

affairs. They have more of a friendship than a professional relationship.

344.2 At some point later that year, Mr Halabi called him and told him that he had

come across something interesting on the internet about Mr Azima. As far as

he could recall Mr Halabi sent him the website address where the material

could be found in a WhatsApp message. He cannot check because he

regularly deletes his WhatsApp messages for security reasons. Mr Halabi

also told him that he believed the information came from the UAE. Mr Page

did not ask why he thought this.

344.3 When Mr Page received this information from Mr Halabi, he would have

picked up the phone to Mr Buchanan although he does not specifically

remember doing so. He believes that Mr Buchanan asked him then to contact

Neil Gerrard at Dechert and let him know what he had heard but it may have

been the other way round.

344.4 A few weeks later, he learned that a second set of data relating to Mr Azima

had been put onto the Internet. He cannot recall when or how exactly he

learned of this. As he had not discussed the first set with any of his sources

other than Mr Halabi, he believes it may have been Mr Halabi that told him

about the second set but it is possible that he was told by one of his other

sources. He does not recall being told anything about how or when the

second set had been discovered. He believes that he would have called Mr

Buchanan or Mr Gerrard immediately. He made no attempt to download the

data.

344.5 He was never asked to hack or otherwise access Mr Azima's emails or data

by RAKIA or anyone else. He does not know who hacked Mr Azima's

computers or placed his data online. His involvement in this matter was

limited to passing on of information provided by sources to RAKIA.

345. Mr Page’s evidence in cross-examination was different from his witness statement

in that he claimed that he passed on the information that he had received from Mr

Halabi on a single occasion and that was the end of his involvement.

110

“A… I passed on the information -- as I said, this was not a mandate from Mr

Buchanan. This was, "Please have a look". I found it. I passed it on. That was

the end of my involvement in that particular exercise, which again was not a

mandate. It was just, "Can you do this?"

Q. So after you had passed on this information t Mr Buchanan and Mr Gerrard

for the first time – after you'd initially passed it on -- that was the end of you

contacting them in that regard?

A. Other than that I am aware, because I am aware, that they hired a specialist

-- computer forensic specialist to download the material. Other than that, I'm

not aware of -- and I am aware, my Lord, that Decherts have reviewed,

interrogated the information, but other than that, I'm not aware of anything else.

Q. But as far as you're concerned, Mr Halabi gave you the information, the two

links, you then passed it on on the phone to Messrs Buchanan and Gerrard or

one or both of them; is that right?

A. Yes, that's correct, my Lord.

Q. And you didn't pass on any further links to either those gentlemen

subsequently?

A. My Lord, I run at that time a company turning over - I am the chairman of

a company turning over £27 million a year. I am running complex contracts in

hostile environments. This was a favour for Mr Buchanan. It was not -- I didn't

keep -- it was literally, "Can you do it?" I passed the information on and that

was it. I don't recall, I could not possibly recall, four years -- nearly four years

down the road or something, my Lord -- four years after the event, what exactly

was said and what I said and who I said because I run a very big organisation.

I'm the chairman of the group.”

346. Mr Halabi’s evidence in his witness statement was as follows:

346.1 Mr Page called him in March or April 2016 and asked him to keep an eye

out for anything interesting and unusual relating to RAK, the Ruler, Dr

Massaad and Mr Azima. He sometimes makes requests such as this.

346.2 Following this request, he searched for those names on Google. He saw there

were many articles about those individuals already. Every couple of days he

would search again to see if there was anything new, interesting or different.

He also spoke to a few contacts he was working with in the Gulf to check

that he had the right names and to ask them to contact him if they heard or

saw anything.

346.3 In early August 2016, whilst working in his home office, in one of his regular

Google searches, he found links to a torrent containing information relating

to Mr Azima. He thought it looked interesting because the title referred to

Mr Azima being exposed. He called Mr Page and told him that he had found

something that Mr Page might find interesting. He provided Mr Page with

two links via Whatsapp. Following his call to Mr Page, they did not discuss

the matter again. He was not interested in the data because it was not relevant

to his area of work as there was no Israeli connection.

111

347. Mr Halabi’s evidence in cross-examination was also to the effect that he spoke to

Mr Page on a single occasion:

“Q. So can his Lordship take it that the only occasion when you spoke to Mr

Page to tell him that you had found some interesting information of the sort that

he had asked you to look out for was this call in August 2016?

A. In this matter, yes.

Q. So you had not spoken to Mr Page about any other interesting material that

you'd found before the August 3 call?

A. No, because I didn't have any interesting material until that time, my Lord.

Q. Yes, and nor did you speak to Mr Page again after this first call in relation to

this matter?

A. We didn't mention this matter -- he didn't mention it, I didn't mention it, and I

think it's over and I don't know what happened there and what happened after

that. Now I know because of the court, but at that time it was something that I

did to him as a favour and it's over for me, my Lord.”

348. RAKIA’s case concerning the discovery of the blogging websites raises a number

of questions.

348.1 There is no obvious reason why an Israeli journalist should have been asked

by Mr Page to conduct the task of looking for references to Mr Azima and

others via simple Google searches. There was no suggestion in the witness

statements of Mr Page or Mr Halabi that Mr Halabi had been asked to look

for references in Arabic. Even if Mr Page was, as he claimed, not able to

carry out simple Google searches himself, the other consultants engaged by

RAKIA, or, most obviously, Insight or Digitalis, could have done this.

RAKIA’s pleaded case was that Bell Pottinger and Digitalis were engaged

by RAKIA to monitor the press, internet and other media reports for

references to individuals including Mr Azima.

348.2 From Mr Halabi’s perspective, he had no reason to undertake the work apart

from as a favour to a friend (though in his witness statement he did not say

that he and Mr Page were friends). He was not paid. His alleged area of

expertise is on the “relationship between Israel and Arab countries”. Mr

Halabi accepted that the material he found had no connection to his work and

was of no interest to him.

348.3 The assertion in Mr Halabi’s witness statement that he had conducted

searches every “couple of days” would mean that Mr Halabi had, from March

or April 2016, conducted searches every other day, and continued doing so

despite finding nothing of interest until early August 2016 (in other words,

at least some 50 times). In his oral evidence Mr Halabi suggested that a

“couple of days” should be read as “some days” or “from time to time”.

Under cross-examination on what he meant by this, Mr Halabi was evasive

and eventually claimed a lapse of memory and that he was unable to assist

on this important point.

112

“Q: Can you answer that question?

A. I answered, my Lord. I answered the question. I said -- I said that it's

from time to time, several times, every -- maybe it's three days, three days,

then maybe week, and it's not something that I remember very well how

often I do it and which times because I didn't write any documents or

comments about it because it was a favour for a friend, my Lord.

Q: So is it right, Mr Halabi, that you can't actually provide any accurate

indication to his Lordship as to how often you think, even approximately,

you performed these searches?

A: It was, my Lord, a long time ago and I don't remember”

348.4 Mr Halabi said that he never spoke to Mr Page about these matters again after

providing him with the links. However, there is no apparent reason why he

would or should have considered that the task had come to an end: on his

own account, he did not know what the data was for. He does not suggest

that Mr Page told him to stop searching; he appears simply to have assumed

that “it’s over”.

349. RAKIA’s case as to the transmission of information from Mr Halabi to Mr Page and

from Mr Page to Mr Gerrard and Mr Buchanan is not directly evidenced by any

documents (the relevant communications are said to have made by a now deleted

WhatsApp message and by phone). There is some contemporaneous documentation

consisting of emails emanating from Mr Gerrard, Mr Buchanan and NTi. This is

inconsistent with Mr Page’s and Mr Halabi’s evidence.

349.1 Mr Halabi’s evidence was that he found two links in the course of the same

Google search and provided them to Mr Page by WhatsApp shortly

afterwards, on the same day after he had spoken to Mr Page by phone and

that he did not speak to Mr Page about it again. In his witness statement he

said that following his call to Mr Page, he and Mr Page “did not discuss the

matter again.” Mr Halabi was asked about this in cross-examination:

“Q. So can his Lordship take it that the only occasion when you spoke to Mr

Page to tell him that you had found some interesting information of the sort

that he had asked you to look out for was this call in August 2016?

A. In this matter, yes.”

349.2 Mr Halabi’s evidence would suggest that he had come across the Exposed

blog and forwarded to Mr Page the two links mentioned on that blog (a

“piratebay” link and a “molova” link) (in the course of cross-examination,

Mr Halabi said he did not recognise either the Exposed blog or the Scammer

blog but no other source for his information about the links was suggested).

349.3 This evidence is inconsistent with the email from Mr del Rosso (who had by

this stage been contacted by Mr Gerrard) to Chris Swecker on 9 August 2016.

This refers to the “piratebay” link and the “monova” link being discovered

and notified on two different days, not on a single occasion, the piratebay

113

link being “discovered” at some time in the week beginning 1 August 2016,

and the monova link on the weekend of 6-7 August 2016. It reads as follows:

“I've spoken to Rich Garcia and agreed that you will instruct his

company on this matter. I've told him that as recently as last week - we

were advised by researchers that a deep web search indicated that data

relating to Farhad Azima was on a site:

https://thepiratebay.Org/torrent/15484452 and we'd initially like to learn

exactly what is there. In addition, over this past weekend, we were told

that another sitehttps://monova.org/42248895 also held either the same

or additional information on Azima and indications that there may be

further sites with more information. I'm not sure if the deep web is the

same as the dark web but I'm sure NTI will know I'm not able to access

the first site (piratebay.org) and it's most likely my ISP or lack of

technical prowess, preventing me.”

349.4 Mr del Rosso’s email also refers to the links being identified with “deep web”

searches. This is inconsistent with Mr Halabi’s and Mr Page’s account in two

respects. Mr Halabi was clear that he conducted only simple Google

searches. Mr Page and Mr Halabi also maintain in any event that Mr Halabi

provided no information to Mr Page about the way the links were

“discovered”.

349.5 Mr Page said that he only spoke to Mr Gerrard on one occasion (on or

about 8 or 9 August 2016). However, Mr Gerrard’s email of 15 August 2016

to Mr del Rosso referred to a second call:

“I've had another call from Stuart who confirms again that there is a

website on FA. He seems to think it's been generated from a UAE source.

I've asked for details. He said he would try and get them to me. Can you

undertake a search for it?”

There is no evidence that Mr Gerrard sought further details from Mr Page.

349.6 It is RAKIA’s pleaded case that a link to a second BitTorrent download was

found in early September 2016 and that Mr Page was informed of the

existence of the link by an unidentified “person who was not engaged by or

acting on behalf of RAKIA”. Mr Del Rosso’s email dated 1 September

2016 reads as follows:

“The client's 'spotter' in Dubai has reported a new data dump. I can't open

the message (no good signal) to give you the link - could you search and

if anything exists, download. If not I'll get home tonight and will be able

to open the file with the supposed links.”

349.7 Mr Del Rosso stated in his witness statement that he had assumed that the

“spotter” was Mr Page. However, as noted above, Mr Page’s evidence was

that, once he had provided the first two links allegedly identified by Mr

114

Halabi to Mr Gerrard and Mr Buchanan on or around 8 or 9 August 2016, he

considered the task complete and did not contact Mr Gerrard or Mr Buchanan

again. Mr Halabi was also clear that he only spoke to Mr Page on one

occasion.

349.8 There is therefore no explanation in the evidence as to how RAKIA found

out about the Second Tranche of Data.

350. There are further discrepancies between the evidence of Mr Page and the documents.

On 16 August 2016 Mr Buchanan emailed Mr Frank and Mr Handjani, copied to

Mr Gerrard, as follows.

“Good morning. I have been informed by Stuart last night that there is an

internet site that is carrying a huge amount of material relating to FA - I will

get you the link later. I have asked Neil to have a team start reviewing the

material as a matter of urgency. At this time, I have no idea whether this

relates to us or whether it is of value in respect of our ongoing dispute with

KM. More importantly, I cannot tell you whether there is anything on the site

about which we should have any concern. Clearly, it would be very

interesting to know who is behind this action - Stuart tells me it is UAE

based. We will speak later. Jamie”

351. This email raises further questions.

351.1 The email reads as Mr Buchanan was “breaking the news” regarding the

hacked material (as Mr Buchanan accepted in cross-examination) even

though, on RAKIA’s case, Mr Buchanan had been informed of the Hacked

Material by Mr Page over a week before, on 8 or 9 August 2016.

351.2 Mr Page denies contacting either Mr Gerrard or Mr Buchanan after the initial

alleged call in which he passed on the two links from Mr Halabi, which is

said to have taken place on 8 or 9 August 2016. It follows that Mr Page did

not contact Mr Buchanan on 15 August 2016.

351.3 Mr Buchanan’s email states that he would “get the link later”. There is no

evidence that Mr Buchanan ever did get “the link” or that any of the

recipients of the email followed up to ask for the link. Mr Gerrard’s evidence

is that he believed that he “already had it by then” but there is no evidence

that Mr Gerrard was provided with a link on 15 August 2016 or that he

provided a link to anyone else at that time or thereafter. The emails between

Mr del Rosso and NTi do not identify any such new link being provided.

351.4 No reply was sent to this email at all, by any of the recipients despite the

dramatic nature of the news that Mr Buchanan had ‘broken’.

351.5 The email refers to “Stuart”, meaning that Mr Buchanan understood his

audience – Mr Frank and Mr Handjani – to know who Mr Page was and

that he was undertaking some sort of work for RAKIA.

115

However, Mr Handjani’s evidence was that he did not know who Mr Page

was until the trial. It would therefore not have made sense for Mr Buchanan

to have referred to Mr Page in this way in an email to Mr Handjani.

352. RAKIA’s account of how it discovered the hacked material is unsatisfactory.

352.1 There was no convincing explanation for Mr Page’s alleged enlisting of an

Israeli journalist acquaintance to carry out simple Google searches nor for

Mr Halabi’s alleged searching, for no remuneration, on a regular basis for

month after month.

352.2 The evidence of Mr Page was both internally inconsistent and inconsistent

with the contemporaneous documents.

352.3 There was no explanation from RAKIA’s side as to how it came across the

Second Tranche of Internet Data in September. Even assuming in RAKIA’s

favour that (as pleaded by RAKIA) Mr Page told RAKIA about the second

tranche (and that he had simply forgotten this conversation when giving

evidence), there is no explanation as to where Mr Page got his information

from. Mr Halabi was consistent that he only spoke to Mr Page on one

occasion, in connection with the first set of links, in early August. It follows

that someone else must have informed Mr Page about the second tranche but

that person has not been identified.

353. RAKIA did not attempt to reconcile all these discrepancies. It accepted that its

account of how it discovered the links to the hacked material was “messy and

unclear” but contended that the reason it was “messy and unclear” was because it

was true; if it had been intent on deception, it would have been relatively

straightforward for RAKIA to devise a mechanism, such as a simple Google alert,

for “discovering” the links (which were publicly available and discovered more or

less at the same time by Mr Azima and his associates). As against this point, it was

reasonably submitted on behalf of Mr Azima that an explanation along the lines of

a simple Google alert would not have distanced RAKIA from the “discovery” in the

way that Mr Page’s account, involving Mr Halabi, did. RAKIA also submitted if

that, if they were sophisticated plotters, they would not have disclosed, or would

have concocted more efficiently, the documents which were said to be inconsistent

with the witness evidence, such as Mr Buchanan’s email with its erroneous reference

to a “call last night”.

354. In my judgment, it is not enough for RAKIA to say that, because it is messy and

unclear, its evidence as to how it discovered the hacked material should be accepted

as true. There is no obvious reason why a truthful account of how it came across the

evidence could not have been clear and coherent.

355. I conclude from the unexplained contradictions, inconsistences and implausible

elements that RAKIA’s case that Mr Page discovered the blogging websites linked

to the BitTorrent sites innocently via Mr Halabi and another unidentified informer

116

is not true and that the true facts as to how RAKIA came to know about the hacked

material have not been disclosed.

356. It does not of course necessarily follow from this conclusion that RAKIA was

responsible for the hacking. As RAKIA pointed out, there would be variety of

explanations for Mr Page’s failure to give a true account of the discovery. He may,

for example, have wanted to conceal his sources of information, even though they

were not the hackers, for reasons of confidentiality.

(10) RAKIA’s deployment of the hacked data

357. Mr Azima submits that RAKIA’s responsibility for the hacking should be inferred

from the fact that, apart from RAKIA no other party in any jurisdiction has sought

to use any of Mr Azima’s stolen material in any proceedings or indicated that it was

able to access the stolen data using the BitTorrent sites.

358. RAKIA’s response to that argument is that Mr Azima appears to have been the

subject of long term interest by Iran who perceived him as an enemy of the Iranian

Government and who actively sought to acquire information and intelligence about

him by targeting his communications and the communications of his close

associates. In particular:

358.1 On 2 September 2012, for example, Ms Azadeh sent an email to Mr Azima

which described how Mr Azima was being spied on by agents of Iran. The

email was sent after Ms Azadeh was arrested and detained for more than three

months by the Iranian Government and Revolutionary Guards.

358.2 On 24 February 2016, Ms Azadeh emailed Mr Azima a detailed account of

her arrest and detention in Iran which made it clear that she and her

communications were deliberately targeted by the Iranian state because of her

close connection to Mr Azima, whom the Iranians believed was working with

the CIA. She went on to explain that, “They had access to my computer and

emails” and that she was eventually released after being “made to confess that

I was a CIA agent and I was working with Farhad Azima in relation to all anti-

Islamic government activities supported by U.S.”

358.3 Jay Solomon, a former journalist for the Wall Street Journal, published an

article in the Columbia Journalism Review dated 7 March 2018 which stated

his belief that the Government of Iran was responsible for the hacking of Mr

Azima’s emails. The article recounted how emails between him and Mr

Azima were hacked and put on the web as a torrent file. This happened just

weeks after his first story broke in August 2016 about the Obama

administration’s secret cash shipments to Iran.

358.4 On 18 July 2016 – two weeks before the First Tranche of the Internet Data was

published online – Ms Azadeh filed a lawsuit against the Islamic Republic of

Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps before the United States

117

District Court for the District of Columbia. The lawsuit described how Ms

Azadeh was detained in Evin Prison, Tehran where she was tortured, drugged

and subjected to mock executions, and interrogated “about the cargo airline

company at which she had worked since May in 2005 in various corporate

roles” (this is a reference to HeavyLift). The US Court subsequently delivered

a detailed judgment which found (amongst other things) that during her

detention in Iran officials of the Revolutionary Guard “demanded that [Ms

Azadeh] give them the passwords to her email and electronic devices” and

interrogated her “about her employment with HeavyLift, specifically about the

company’s contracts with the U.S. Department of Defence”. In September

2018, the US Court awarded Ms Azadeh damages of more than $36m against

the Republic of Iran and the Revolutionary Guard.

358.5 There is evidence that persons in Iran attempted to gain access to Mr Azima’s

accounts. In particular, on 1 May 2016 an email was sent to Mr Azima’s

farhad@farhadazima.com email account from an email address entitled

“administration@farhadazima.com”. It stated that Mr Azima’s account had

been disabled and invited him to click on a link “where we’ll ask you some

questions to verify your identity”. The email was bogus and was not a genuine

account recovery message. The phishing email was sent from an IP address in

Iran – indicating that Mr Azima was being actively targeted by a person or

persons within that country.

358.6 In addition to the apparent targeting of Mr Azima’s devices and

communications by agents of the Iranian state, it is apparent that third parties

managed to gain unauthorised access to Mr Azima’s email accounts. For

example:

(a) On 5 April 2015, Mr Azima sent a text message to Mr Adams asking if

Mr Adams had changed the password on his Gmail account because

unusual activity had been detected on the account. Mr Adams replied that

he had not changed the password. Mr Azima then replied: “I bet it is

hacked”.

(b) On 12 April 2016, Mr Azima sent an email to Ray Adams which showed

that a third party had managed to send spam messages from his

farhad@farhadazima.com email account. Mr Azima’s email stated:

“Looks like I am hacked”.

(c) On 10 June 2016, Mr Azima sent another email to Mr Adams which again

showed that a third party had managed to send spam messages from his

farhad@farhadazima.com email account. Mr Azima stated: “Ray, does

this means [sic] my email act [sic] is hacked again?”.

(d) Two days later, Mr Azima sent a further email to Mr Adams which

showed another spam message had been sent by a third party from his

farhad@farhadazima.com email account. Mr Azima stated: “Hacked

again!”

118

358.7 Accordingly, not only has Mr Azima failed to establish that RAKIA was

directly or indirectly responsible for hacking his emails, it is apparent that

various other third parties had access to Mr Azima’s accounts and may have

had the means and motivation to access, publish and utilise his electronic data.

358.8 In early August 2016, despite his claim that he was threatened by Mr Gerrard

a few weeks earlier, Mr Azima did not suspect RAK or RAKIA had hacked

his emails. His suspicion came only when RAKIA brought proceedings based

on the hacked data.

359. Mr Azima’s response to the theory that the Iranian state may be responsible for the

hacking is, in short, as follows.

359.1 The evidence concerning Ms Azadeh’s arrest by the Iranian authorities, her

apprehension that those authorities were surveilling her and others, and her

lawsuit against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard does not come close to

establishing that the Iranian authorities may have hacked Mr Azima, still less

that they are a more likely culprit than RAKIA. In particular:

(a) Ms Azadeh’s arrest was in May 2012, more than 4 years prior to the

publication of the BitTorrent sites.

(b) Ms Azadeh was released by the Iranian authorities after paying a

fine (in lieu of lashes); this is hardly consistent with a theory that

those authorities regarded her or Mr Azima as connected with the

CIA.

(c) There is no evidence at all that the Iranian state or its authorities

have sought to use the hacked material, to contact Mr Azima in

relation to it or to take advantage of it.

(d) The email to Mr Azima on 1 May 2016 was sent well after access

had been obtained to his email accounts. The fact that the apparent

IP address registers in Iran does not itself indicate that the sender

was actually located in Iran. In the copy of the hacked material that

is available in these proceedings, the malicious email appears in a

junk email folder. As the email was in a junk email folder, it appears

unlikely to have been opened by Mr Azima. The email does not

appear in the image taken of Mr Azima’s emails after the hacking

was discovered.

(e) The fact that Mr Azima did not immediately perceive RAKIA and

the Ruler to be responsible for the hacking upon learning of the

BitTorrent sites is of no consequence. He mistakenly believed that

he had a good relationship with the Ruler and RAKIA.

119

360. In my judgment, the evidence of the possible involvement of Iran in the hacking,

while falling far short of showing that Iran had any responsibility for the hacking,

does at least displace any inference that RAKIA must have been responsible for

carrying out the hacking because no other party conceivably had the means or the

motivation to do so.

(11) The inability of RAKIA’s IT expert to download all the internet data in April

2017

361. Mr Azima relies on the fact that in proceedings in the United States brought by Mr

Azima, RAKIA appointed an IT expert who “could obtain only a portion of Mr

Azima’s material” from the internet in April 2017. Mr Azima contends that,

“RAKIA’s own computing expert was therefore unable to replicate the process by

which RAKIA claims…to have obtained the stolen data” and this therefore supports

his case that RAKIA was responsible for the hacking.

362. RAKIA submits that there is no merit in this argument on the following grounds:

362.1 RAKIA’s US expert attempted to download the hacked data between 31

March and 10 April 2017 – more than seven months after the hacked data first

became available. The fact that he was able to download some, but not all, of

the hacked data in April 2017 does not provide any insight into the availability

of the hacked data some seven or eight months earlier.

362.2 The parties’ independent forensic IT Experts agree that “the availability of

data shared over a torrent may change over time and that it is not possible to

retrace peer to peer activity”. Mr Krone, RAKIA’s expert, further explains

that the availability and ease of download of the torrent files relating to Mr

Azima were likely to have varied on a daily or even hourly basis depending

on the number of “seeders” (i.e. users uploading data previously downloaded

from other users) available at any specific time, the existence of servers

keeping track of the location of seeders and their immediate availability and

the number of people attempting to download the same shared file.

363. For the reasons advanced by RAKIA, I agree that the inability of RAKIA’s

computing US expert to download the hacked material does not provide any support

for Mr Azima’s case that RAKIA was responsible for the hacking.

(12) “Deliberately withheld documents”

364. Mr Azima contends that certain materials that had been within Mr Azima’s emails

were not included among the hacked materials on the BitTorrent sites. Those include

materials that would be damaging to RAK, including the so-called Smoking Gun

report about the arrest of the Ruler for sexual assault.

365. The Experts have not been able to confirm whether the materials in question would

have been available to the hackers. The evidence of Mr Krone, RAKIA’s expert,

120

was that as Mr Azima did not provide him with access to the preserved devices or a

contemporaneous copy of the devices/accounts that Mr Azima alleges were

compromised, it was impossible for him to confirm what material was stored on

those devices/accounts at the time they were hacked and therefore it was impossible

to identify any differences between that material and the content of the data on the

internet. Mr Tarbell agrees that it is impossible to confirm what material would have

been found on or in Mr Azima’s devices/accounts at the time they were

compromised and thus whether any of that material was withheld from the Internet

Data.

366. RAKIA also points out that on 12 September 2019 RAKIA made a request for

further information asking how many documents in total had allegedly been

withheld from the hacked data on the BitTorrent sites and whether Mr Azima had

taken any steps to identify documents that were allegedly withheld and which were

not damaging to the reputation of RAK or RAKIA. Mr Azima refused to answer

those questions on the grounds that the information requested was not needed or

was privileged. RAKIA submits that it is to be inferred that either Mr Azima has

failed to examine whether any documents not damaging to RAKIA/RAK were

withheld from the hacked materials on the BitTorrent sites or Mr Azima has

examined that issue and has concluded that the category of withheld documents does

include documents which are not damaging to RAKIA/RAK.

367. I accept that Mr Azima’s failure to provide clarification as to which documents were

withheld from the materials available on the BitTorrent sites means that no weight

can be placed on his argument that documents allegedly missing from the hacked

material on the BitTorrent sites show that RAKIA must have been responsible for

the hacking.

(13) Mr Page’s “track record”

368. It is submitted for Mr Azima that, in assessing the inherent likelihood of Mr Page

arranging for committing the hacking, I should take into account what is alleged to

be his track record of involvement with other instances of hacking and illegal

information gathering, as follows.

368.1 In the case of Dubai Aluminium v Al Alawi [1998] EWHC 1202 a sub-agent

engaged by Mr Page had obtained confidential information using pretext calls,

which Mr Justice Rix found to be illegal (and which Mr Page accepted was

illegal). Mr Page said he did not instruct the subagent to act illegally and was

unaware of it at the time.

368.2 Following Mr Page’s engagement by the Board of Control for Cricket in India

to investigate several board members and players, confidential emails passing

between individuals (who were the subject of the inquiry) found their way to

the media. Page Protective Services was accused of obtaining unauthorised

121

access to those emails. In his oral evidence Mr Page denied being involved in

the illegal obtaining of emails.

368.3 Most recently, Mr Page was associated with the theft of confidential

documents by Israeli hackers. Sir Andrew Smith had noted in passing, in the

course of a judgment in JSC BTA Bank v Ablyazov [2018] EWHC 259

(Comm) that the claimant bank was contacted in early 2016 by Mr Page who

claimed to act for unnamed Israeli hackers who had extracted information

from a computer belonging to a Mr Aggarwal, an accountant. Mr Page was

asked to approach the Bank to find out whether it was interested in obtaining

the information which might be useful in relation to claims brought by the

bank.

369. These cases highlight the fact that Mr Page operates in a world of covert surveillance

in which agents acquire confidential information unlawfully and that Mr Page has

dealings with such agents. It would be a reasonable inference to draw from these

incidents that Mr Page has access to agents with the capacity to hack emails.

However these other incidents do not establish that Mr Page ever personally carried

out or authorised the unlawful obtaining of confidential information and therefore

do not affect my assessment of the inherent likelihood of Mr Page acting unlawfully

in this case. Mr Azima also relied on the level of Mr Page’s remuneration of between

$100,000 and $300,000 per month as being “consistent with Mr Page obtaining

information by illicit means and of seeking a premium for such nefarious activity.”

Mr Page was certainly generously remunerated but I do not consider that his rate of

remuneration can sensibly be taken as a sign of illicit activity.

(14) Allegations against Mr Gerrard

370. The serious allegations made against Mr Gerrard in proceedings brought by

Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (“ENRC”) against the Serious Fraud

Office (the “SFO”) in which it is alleged that Mr Gerrard leaked information

covered by ENRC’s confidentiality and privilege to journalists and to the SFO, in

breach of his fiduciary duties and his retainer with ENRC and set to overcharge

ENRC, are no more than unproven allegations denied by Mr Gerrard and are

similarly of no assistance in the present case.

(15) RAKIA’s conduct of other litigation

371. For Mr Azima it was alleged that RAKIA’s conduct of litigation has been highly

improper, showing that RAKIA (and on occasion its lawyers) were willing to break

the rules in pursuit of its own ends.

371.1 First, a chain of emails in June 2016 involving Mr Buchanan, and lawyers at

Dechert and Pillsbury describes a plan for two former Georgian judges, now

employed by Pillsbury, to seek to have certain cases heard by a particular

judge as a “personal favour”. The emails refer to those individuals

122

demonstrating “influence with the judiciary”. Mr Buchanan accepted that this

was inappropriate.

371.2 Second, it was alleged that RAKIA Georgia had put improper pressure on Gela

Mikadze through the Georgian government. In August 2013 the then CEO of

RAKIA Georgia wrote to the then CEO of RAKIA and others in relation to

the support that RAKIA could seek to obtain from the Georgian government

in its dispute with Mr Mikadze. Mr Buchanan agreed that enlisting the

support of a government and threatening imprisonment in order to pressure

him into settling a dispute was an improper thing to do.

371.3 Third, it was alleged that in September 2014 RAKIA had lobbied the Georgian

government to put pressure on Dr Massaad. Mr Bustami had emailed

individuals in the Ruler’s office, copying Mr Gerrard, indicating that RAK

intended to “target” certain outcomes.

371.4 Fourth, it was alleged that documents confidential to Mr Mikadze, who has

been embroiled in litigation with RAKIA in Georgia since 2015, were mailed

anonymously to RAKIA’s lawyers (Dechert) marked for the attention of Mr

Gerrard. It was submitted that RAKIA’s receipt of confidential information

from anonymous benefactors in two sets of proceedings cannot be coincidental

and that a more likely explanation is that RAKIA or an agent acting on its

behalf obtained the material illicitly and then sought to ‘launder’ it by

providing it anonymously through the post.

372. The circumstances of these other incidents do not, in my view establish that RAKIA

had a highly improper attitude to litigation and do not shed any useful light on the

issue of whether RAKIA was responsible for the hacking of Mr Azima’s emails in

the present case.

372.1 The first incident comprised a proposal by a lawyer working for Pillsbury to

speed up the disposal of two cases by persuading a judge to hear them before

his retirement.

372.2 The second incident did not involve the individuals concerned in the present

proceedings. Moreover, the email about which complaint is made was copied

to RAK’s lawyers.

372.3 The third incident, involving the suggestion that RAK should enlist the support

of the Georgian government in its pursuit of claims against Dr Massaad, was

not in itself improper. Mr Bustami was not advocating support inconsistent

with Dr Massaad’s legal rights.

372.4 As to the fourth incident, I am not in any position to draw any conclusions as

to whether documents confidential to Mr Mikadze were obtained illicitly.

There is, in any event, no suggestion that the documents were obtained by

email hacking.

123

Conclusions on the hacking claim

373. Email hacking, or the gaining of authorised access to a person’s email account, is

self-evidently a serious wrongdoing, a violation of privacy and a criminal offence

under the Computer Misuse Act 1990.

374. Mr Azima invites me to find, on the balance of probabilities, not only that Mr Page,

acting on the instructions or with the connivance of the Ruler, arranged for Mr

Azima’s emails to be hacked, but also that RAKIA’s main witnesses, Mr Buchanan,

Mr Gerrard, the Ruler, Mr Page, Mr Halabi, Mr Handjani and Mr Bustami, have

conspired to present a false case to the Court concerning RAKIA’s lack of

involvement in the hacking and have given perjured evidence in support of that false

case.

375. It is trite law that cogent evidence is required to justify a finding of discreditable

conduct and that “the cogency of the evidence relied upon must be commensurate

with the seriousness of the conduct alleged”. This is because of the inherent

improbability of people committing serious wrongdoing. Most people are not

serious wrongdoers and, even if capable of serious wrongdoing, are likely to be

deterred by the fear of detection. Thus as Andrew Smith J stated in Fiona Trust v

Privalov [2010] EWHC 3199 (Comm) at 1438:

"It is well established that “cogent evidence is required to justify a finding of

fraud or other discreditable conduct”: per Moore-Bick LJ in Jafari-Fini v

Skillglass Ltd., [2007] EWCA Civ 261 at para.73. This principle reflects the

court's conventional perception that it is generally not likely that people will

engage in such conduct: “where a claimant seeks to prove a case of

dishonesty, its inherent improbability means that, even on the civil burden of

proof, the evidence needed to prove it must be all the stronger”, per Rix LJ in

Markel v Higgins, [2009] EWCA 790 at para 50. The question remains one

of the balance of probability, although typically, as Ungoed-Thomas J put it

in In re Dellow's Will Trusts, [1964] 1 WLR 415 , 455 (cited by Lord

Nicholls in In re H, [1996] AC 563 at p.586H), “The more serious the

allegation the more cogent the evidence required to overcome the

unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it". Associated with the

seriousness of the allegation is the seriousness of the consequences, or

potential consequences, of the proof of the allegation because of the

improbability that a person will risk such consequences: see R(N) v Mental

Health Review Tribunal (Northern Region), [2005] EWCA 1605 para 62,

cited in Re Doherty, [2008] UKHL 33 para 27 per Lord Carswell.”

376. The forensic evidence established that the hacking of Mr Azima’s emails could have

taken place in October 2015 but it is common ground that it is impossible from the

forensic evidence to identify the hackers. Mr Azima’s case that Mr Page engaged

agents to carry out the hacking therefore depends on inferences to be drawn from a

series of pieces of circumstantial evidence, what Counsel for Mr Azima referred to

as “a few but very powerful forensic pointers”.

124

377. I consider that the following facts and matters support the inference that the hacking

of Mr Azima’s emails was carried out by Mr Page acting on the instructions of the

Ruler:

377.1 The fact that, as reported in Mr Page’s Project Update, in early 2015 Mr Azima

was being monitored by sophisticated surveillance specialists engaged by Mr

Page who planned to gather intelligence on the progress of the team of advisors

managed by Mr Azima in the US to spread allegations against RAK and the

Ruler in order to “monitor their activities and attempt to contain or ruin their

plans”;

377.2 The fact that in 2015 the Ruler felt hostile towards Mr Azima, probably

because of the matters reported in the Project Update, leading the Ruler to

express the wish in April and again in July 2015 that Mr Azima should be

targeted and gone after; he wished to obtain information about the role Mr

Azima had played in Dr Massaad’s schemes;

377.3 The fact that throughout 2015 the Ruler had regular monthly meetings with

Mr Page to discuss the ongoing investigations organised by Mr Page into Dr

Massaad’s activities, sometimes on a one to one basis without the involvement

of Mr Buchanan;

377.4 The fact that in December 2015 plans were being drawn up by RAKIA for a

media campaign against Mr Azima, who was suspected of orchestrating and

participating in fraudulent activities, alongside Dr Massaad;

377.5 The fact that the blogging sites attacking Dr Massaad and the sites attacking

Mr Azima with links to the hacked material appeared within a few days of

each other, suggesting that both attacks were coordinated and directed on

behalf of RAKIA/the Ruler, (although, as noted above, I recognise that the

coincidental timing may also suggest that RAKIA was not involved);

377.6 The implausible nature of the evidence adduced by RAKIA to explain how Mr

Page discovered the blogging sites and the second tranche of data, suggesting

that Mr Page, whom I considered to be an unreliable witness, was not

disclosing all the facts.

378. As against these considerations, there are a number of significant features of Mr

Azima’s hacking case which are improbable and point away from RAKIA being

responsible for the hacking, as follows:

378.1 The inherent improbability of RAKIA, several months after Mr Azima’s

emails were hacked and at a time when, ex hypothesi, it had had time to

analyse the contents of the material hacked in October 2015, entering into

the Settlement Agreement with Mr Azima and paying Mr Azima $2.6

million; Mr Azima’s explanation for the Settlement Agreement as a device

to trap him is not compelling;

125

378.2 The inherent improbability of RAKIA negotiating the ISR joint venture with

GDS, of which Mr Azima was a shareholder and director, at a time when it

had ex hypothesi concluded, on the basis of the hacked material, that Mr

Azima was a fraudster;

378.3 The absence in RAKIA’s internal communications in the period following

October 2015 of any reference to the hacking or information clearly derived

from the hacking;

378.4 The fact that from October 2015 onwards RAKIA did not make use of the

hacked material other than as the basis for bringing proceedings to recover

the settlement sum and did not use the material to exert leverage on Mr

Azima in his role as go between with Dr Massaad;

378.5 The inherent improbability of RAKIA’s witnesses, including Mr Gerrard as

a solicitor, conspiring together to conceal RAKIA’s role in the hacking and

participating in proceedings which, if successful, would result in a relatively

modest award of damages and reputational damage to Mr Azima but which

would carry with them a risk of no less serious reputational damage to RAK,

RAKIA and themselves, were the hacking to come to light.

379. I was not persuaded that the View from the Window document or the meeting on 16

July 2016 support Mr Azima’s hacking claim. They do not, in my view, show that Mr

Gerrard was aware of the contents of the hacked material. I was not persuaded that

Mr Buchanan knew about the hacking. More generally, I was not satisfied that there

was sufficiently cogent evidence to establish a conspiracy between the RAKIA

witnesses to advance a false case in these proceedings.

380. I accept that the hypothesis advanced on behalf of Mr Azima that Mr Page, acting

with the express or implied authority of the Ruler, arranged for Mr Azima’s emails to

be hacked, that the Settlement Agreement was entered for tactical reasons and that it

was decided to deploy the hacked material in August 2016 once the ceasefire with Dr

Massaad was over, is not impossible. It would provide an explanation for the fact that

the hacked material came to light when it did and for RAKIA’s failure to provide a

convincing account of its innocent discovery of the hacked material. It is equally not

impossible that Mr Page arranged for Mr Azima’s emails to be hacked without the

knowledge of Mr Gerrard or Mr Buchanan or the Ruler’s advisers so that the

instigation of these proceedings did not entail a conspiracy between them, even

though the witnesses may have harboured suspicions about Mr Page’s role.

381. It is, however, not enough for Mr Azima to advance a case that is not impossible.

Based on all of the documentary and witness evidence, I was not satisfied on the

balance of probabilities that RAKIA was responsible for the hacking of Mr Azima’s

emails. The facts supporting the inference that RAKIA was responsible for the

hacking are far from conclusive and the improbable features of Mr Azima’s case can

only be explained away on the basis of speculative assumptions for which there is no

sufficiently firm evidence.

126

382. Given my conclusion, based on all the evidence, that it has not been proved that

RAKIA was responsible for the hacking of Mr Azima’s emails, the issues which

would have arisen upon a finding that RAKIA’s case was based on illicitly obtained

evidence fall away.

383. Had I upheld the hacking claim, it would have been necessary to decide whether to

admit or exclude the illicitly obtained evidence or to strike out RAKIA’s claim

entirely as I was invited to do by Mr Azima. As the Court of Appeal noted in Jones v

Warwick¸ the decision would have depended on all the circumstances, including my

findings of fact in connection with the hacking.

384. If I had found that RAKIA had hacked Mr Azima’s emails, I would not necessarily

have excluded the illicitly obtained evidence as, without it, RAKIA would have been

unable to prove its claims and Mr Azima would have been left with the benefit of his

seriously fraudulent conduct. If, however, I had found that, as alleged by Mr Azima,

not only had RAKIA hacked Mr Azima’s emails and used them as the evidential basis

of this case, but also that its witnesses had conspired to put forward a fabricated case

concerning RAKIA’s lack of involvement in the hacking, there would have been

strong grounds to strike the proceedings out as an abuse of process, as envisaged in

Summers v Fairclough Homes Ltd.

Overall conclusion

385. Mr Azima is liable to pay RAKIA the sums of $2,600,000 and $1,562,500 making a

total of $4,162,500.

386. I will give directions for the service of submissions on interest and costs.
