NIGEL COOPER K.C. :   Introduction   1. In this action, the Claimant seeks injunctive relief and damages from each of  the Defendants arising out of the circumstances of the termination of the  employment of the First, Second and Third Defendants, who were employee s  of the Claimant. In essence, the Claimant says that , in breach of the express and  implied terms of their contracts of employment and in breach of duty,  each of  the Defendants misappropriated  confidential information and documents from  the Claimant so as to be able to set up a rival business  operating through the  Fourth Defendant, a business established by the First Defendant who was the  sole shareholder and managing director.   2. The hearing before me was the hearing of an application made by the Claimant  by notice dated 21 July 2023 for injunctive relief and directions for a speedy  trial. During the hearing, consent orders were agreed between the Claimant and  the Second and Third Defendants  such that it was finally only necessary for me  to make orders in rela tion to interim injunctive relief  between the Claimant and  the First and Fourth Defendants . The consent order between the Claimant and  the Second Defendant is on a final basis so that no further directions are  necessary in relation to the claims made again st the Second Defendant. The  consent order between the Claimant and the Third Defendant is on an interim  basis so that the directions made for a speedy trial also apply to him.   3. For the purposes of considering the application  as between the Claimant and the   First and Fourth Defendants , I heard  oral submissions from Mr. Northall and  Ms. Husain as well as considering the skeleton arguments lodged by them . In  terms of evidence, I had a witness statement from Mr. Tom Armitage, the  Managing Director of the Claima nt and Mr. Liam Baker, the First Defendant  together with the documents exhibited to their statements and additional  correspondence included in the bundle.    4. I also heard brief submissions from Mr. Irani-Nayar on behalf of the Second   Defendant and from the Third  Defendant in person. Although the Third   Defendant appeared in person, he had previously taken legal advice from  Backhouse solicitors  and was able to contact them during a short adjournment  for the purposes of deciding whether to agree and sign the consent order, which  was put before the court.   5. At the end of the hearing, I granted the Claimant injunctive relief albeit on terms,  which were not as restrictive as originally sought. I also gave  directions to lead  to a speedy trial. Time did not allow me to deliver judgment during the hearing  and I indicated that I would give reasons for my decision in writing following  the hearing. This judgment sets out  those reasons .  6. Before the hearing the First and Fourth Defendants objected to th e hearing going  ahead on the basis that they were not given adequate notice of the hearing and  did not have sufficient time to put in evidence and a skeleton argument in  opposition to the application. In the end, the First and Fourth Defendants lodged  both a witness statement and a skeleton argument. Ms. Husain confirmed at the High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 3 start of the hearing that the First and Fourth Defendants  wished to go ahead and  were not seeking an adjournment of the application.   7. By the time of the hearing, the following matters  were the principal issues,  which I had to determine:   i) Did the Claimant pass the threshold for injunctive relief.   ii) Was the Claima nt entitled to disclosure by Affidavit from the First  and  Fourth  Defendant s?  iii) Was the Claimant entitled to an order for imaging and inspection of  devices belonging to the First and Fourth Defendant s on which  confidential information  was held?   iv) Was the Claimant entitled to an order enforcing post -termination  restrictions on the First Defendant?   v) Was the Claimant entitled to an order for springboard relief against the  First and Fourth Defendants?   8. There was no issue before me as to the definition of confidential information  for the purposes of the order  made . It was also accepted by the F irst and Fourth  Defendants that if the Claimant passed the threshold for injunctive relief  it was  entitled to orders for the preservation and delivery up of confidential  information.   9. Before dealing with each of the matters, which were in issue before me, I  will  set out the  background to the present dispute . In doing so, I make no final  findings of fact, which are a matter for determination at trial.   Background   The Claimant’s  business   10. The Claimant  is an employment business involved in placing candidates for  clients in the construction sector. It presently operates through seven  offices, with a centralised head office providing support services .  11. The business has two core workstreams: (1) sales, through which teams of  employees seek to win and retain work from construction sector clients;  and (2) resourcing, through which teams of employees (known as  ‘resourcers’) find candidates to fill jobs on behalf of clients.   12. The Claimant  employed the First to Third Defendants  at its Essex office  located in Billericay. It established the office at the First Defendant’s   request in 2018.  Prior to his resignation, the First Defendant  was employed  by the Claimant  as a Business Development Manage r and had de facto   responsibility fo r the Billericay office. The Second and Third Defendants   were recruited by the First Defendant  and he had management  responsibility for them. Both were recruited as resourcers.  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 4 13. There is a dispute between the Claimant and the First Defendant as to the  terms  of the First Defendant’s employment and whether, in particular, his  contract of employment contained enforceable PTRs. The contract terms  relied on by the Claimant are found in a n undated  contract of employment  provided to the First Defendant on or about  20 September 2021  (“the  September 2021 contract”) . There is no copy of that contract signed by the  First Defendant.   14. The First Defendant says that he was not prepared to agree to this contract  because it did not contain terms providing him with an ‘exit’ bo nus, which  he says was something he had agreed with Mr. Armitage. The First  Defendant also says that Mr. Armitage’s failure to agree the terms of his exit  bonus  was one of the factors behind his resignation and why he considers  that he was constructively dismissed.   15. The First Defendant continued discussions over the terms of his exit bonus with  Mr. Armitage through 2022 and into 2023  but the evidence before me does not  suggest any wider refusal to accept the terms of the September 2021 cont ract.  He continued to work for the Claimant for nearly two years after being provided  with the September 2021 contract.   16. In correspondence between the First Defendant’s solicitors and the Claimant’s  solicitors, the First Defendant put forward a proposal for u ndertakings he was  prepared to give the Claimant which expressly referred to the definition of  confidential information as defined in clause 16.1 of his employment contract.  The reference to clause 16.1 was a reference to the corresponding clause of the  September 2021 contract.   17. The Billericay office has a niche specialism in ‘facades and steel’ ( i.e.,  construction involving the external face of a building and steel erection). It  was the only office within the City Sites business that serviced the  specialism.   18. It is the Claimant’s case that t he combination of the First, Second and Third  Defendants  provid ed a self -contained team capable of servicing the needs  of clients and candidates. The Claimant has estimated that the trio were  responsible for 85% of the revenue generated by the Billericay office.   Departure of  the First, Second and Third Defendants   19. The First, Second and Third Defendants  resigned their employment with  the Claimant  over the course of 29 and 30 June 2023. The Claimant says  that the circumstances of their resignation strongly indicate that their  departure was a ‘team move’, long in the planning and orchestrated by the  First Defendant  for his own benefit and that of his newly incorporated  business, Cornerstone , the Fourth  Defendant . The Claimant says that their   departure showed a disregard for their employment obligations, their  duties of confidentiality and for City Site’s commercial wellbeing.   The First  Defendant says that he resigned in circumstances such that he was  constructively dismissed.  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 5 20. The Second and Third Defendants tendered their resignation in writing late  on 29 June 2023. CSSL allege that in breach of contract, neither gave notice.   21. The Claimant’s  Managing Director, Tom Armitage, attended the Billericay  office  in person on the morning of 30 June 2023. None of the First to Third  Defendants were there.  The remaining staff told Mr Armitage that they had  not been seen for ‘a couple of days’ and did not know where they were .  22. Mr Armitage met the First Defendant  by a rrangement at the Billericay  office. Mr. Armitage says that the First Defendant  originally wanted to meet  offsite in London, but that he, Mr Armitage , insisted that he attend the  office. In the conversation between them that ensued, Mr. Armitage says  that the First Defendant was truculent and uncooperative. He refused to  assist Mr Armitage in handing over the office’s key tasks and  responsibilities. The Claimant  say that unbeknown to Mr Armitage at that  time, assisted by the Second and Third Defendants , the First Defendant  had  already cannibalised the Claimant’s  confidential business information and  taken steps to harm the ongoing business of the Billericay office.   23. Mr. Armitage’s account of events on 30 June 2023 is disputed by the First  Defendant, who says that Mr. Armitage became aggressive and emotional  such that he feared for his safety.   24. For the purposes of the application before me, I do not have to decide  whose account of events on 30 June is correct. What is not in dispute is that  the First Defendant  handed a resignation letter to Mr Armitage . The letter  claimed that Mr Armitage had failed to honour an earlier agreement as to  Mr Baker’s bonus  and that the circumstances of the First Defendant’s  departure amounted to a constructive dismissal.   IT Investi gation     25. Mr Armitage commissioned the Claimant’s  IT consultant to interrogate its  systems for evidence of wrongdoing. It appears that those investigations  began on 30 June 2023.   26. The Claimant says that the First Defendant  was careless enough to leave  his wor k computer logged into his personal Hotmail email account, with  the email address  for that account . The Claimant  also says that much of the  First Defendant’s  wrongdoing has been shown through his use of the  Hotmail account . The evidence of Mr. Armitage inc ludes a number of  examples of e -mails sent by the First Defendant from his personal Hotmail  account to his -email account with the Fourth Defendant to which are  attached documents and information, which on the evidence presently  available belongs to the Cla imant .  27. The First Defendant  disputes the Claimant’s account of how it came to  access messages on the First Defendant’s Hotmail account. The First  Defendant  alleges that the Claimant has accessed his e -mail account and High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 6 taken information and documents from that account  by effectively ‘hacking  the account’ and acting in a way which is unlawful. I return to this issue  below when considering whether the Claimant has met the threshold for  interim injunctive relief .  28. The Claimant says their investig ations reveal that that the First Defendant  has been engaged in the wholesale misappropriation of its confidential  information and deliberate efforts to harm its ability to retain business at  its Billericay branch.  The First Defendant acknowledges that he has taken  information and documents from the Claimant but disputes how much of  that information is confidential information. The First Defendant disputes  the allegations made against him by the Claimant. However, the witness  statement provided by the First  Defendant for the purposes of this  application does not offer any detailed rebuttal of the actions said by the  Claimant to have been taken by the First Defendant to take information and  documents from the Claimant’s systems.  On the evidence before me, it does  appear that the First Defendant was engaged in a process of transferring  documents and information belonging to the Claimant  and which were  confidential information within the meaning of the First Defendant’s  employment contract  to his personal e -mail  accounts and then on to the  Fourth Defendant.   29. The First Defendant  incorporated the Fourth Defendant on 31 May 2023.  The Standard Industrial Classification Code (SIC) given for the company is  “Other activities of employment placement agencies ” The First Defendant  is  Cornerstone’s sole director and controlling shareholder. A small minority  share is held by Recruithub Platform Ltd (a recruitment platform business  through which new recruitment business launch and seek early growth).   It  is not in dispu te that each of the First to Third Defendants  resigned their  employment with City Site to take up employment with the Fourth  Defendant.   Express and implied contractual terms, fiduciary duties and duties of  confidentiality      30. There is a dispute about the pre cise terms of the First Defendant’s employment ,  whether the PTRs found in the September 2021 contract are enforceable  and to  what extent, if at all, the First Defendant owed the Claimant fiduciary duties .  Ther e was, however, no real challenge to the Claima nt’s position that the First  Defendant owed it express and implied obligations of confidentiality  (clause 15  of the September 2021 contract)  and implied duties of good faith and fidelity, a  duty of cooperation and a duty to preserve the relationship of tru st and  confidence.   31. The express confidentiality provisions found at clause 15 of the September 2021  contract require the First Defendant to deliver up confidential information (as  defined) and not to use, copy or disclose confidential information other than   where expressly authorised in writing by the Claimant.  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 7 32. So far as the PTRs are concerned, these are set out at clause 16 of the September  2021 contract. In brief, their effect was to prevent the First Defendant from  competing with the Claimant by carrying on business from a location within  half a mile of any of the Claimant’s offices for a period of three months post- termination and from using the Claimant’s trade connections and goodwill for  a period of nine months post termination.   The Claimant’s protectable legitimate interests   33. On the question of whether the Claimant has a protectable legitimate interest,  the Claimant referred me to a passage  from the speech of Lord Wilberforce in  Stenhouse Australia Ltd. v. Phillips  [1974] 1 All ER 117  (at 122)  in the  following terms:   “the employer's claim for protection must be based upon the identification of some  advantage or asset inherent in the business  which can properly be regarded as, in a  general sense, his property, and which it would be unjust to allow the employee to  appropriate for his own purposes, even though he, the employee, may have contributed  to its creation. For while it may be true that an employee is entitled - and is to be  encouraged - to build up his own qualities of skill and experience, it is equally his duty  to develop and improve his employer's business for the benefit of his employer. These  two obligations interlock during his emp loyment: after its termination they diverge and  mark the boundary between what the employee may take with him and what he may  legitimately be asked to leave behind to his employers.”   34. The Claimant summarised the advantages or assets, which it was seeking to  protect in the following terms:   i) Long -term, stable relationships with clients are vital to the success of the  business and require significant investment in terms of time and money.   ii) Such a relationship may lead to exclusivity of use (typically in  relation  to smaller clients) or access to preferred supplier lists (in relation to  larger clients).   iii) Clients with a stable, long -term relationship with the Claimant  account  for a disproportionately large percentage of its revenue.   iv) Reliable, up to date info rmation relating to candidates ( including their  skills, availability, experience, location and the like) and clients  (including their current activities, pay rates and key contacts) is the  difference between success and failure.   v) The Claimant  and its compet itors are currently within the summer  season, in which demand far outstrips supply due to a general lack of  candidate availability. Accurate, reliable candidate information is  therefore critical to filling roles on behalf of clients at this time.   vi) The indus try is fast paced . Given t he speed with which roles need to be  filled , using accurate information in relation to known candidates is  more efficient than advertising to fill roles.  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 8 35. Relying on  the evidence of Mr Armitage, the Claimant argues that it  has  protectable legitimate interests in respect of:   i) its trade connections and goodwill;   ii) its confidential information; an d  iii) the stability of its workforce .  36. Having considered the evidence of Mr. Armitage and the rebuttal evidence of  the First Defendant, I accept  for the purposes of this application that the  Claimant can establish to the requisite standard (discussed further below) that it  has a protectable legitimate interest.   Breach of Contract and/or Duty   37. Mr. Armitage set out in some detail in his witness statement, the material which  the Claimant relied on for the purposes of establishing the necessary breaches  by the First Defendant and Fourth Defendant.  Mr. Northall for the Claimant in  his oral and written submissions provided me with what he described a s the  highlights , as follows:   i) On 16 May 2023, the First Defendant  copied 72 internal Claimant   emails. Around half of these emails included details and logins for third - party service providers, such as recruitment sites. One of the emails  included the Claim ant’s access credentials for “Googlesheets”, where  the company keeps commercially sensitive information, including  details of advertisement responses and of the candidates finishing an  assignment. The Claimant says it is reasonable to infer that the First  Defendant  secretly transferred the information with the intention of  exploiting it for his and the Fourth Defendant’s benefit, but to the  Claimant’s  detriment .  ii) On 10 June 2023, the First Defendant  sent from his personal email to h is  email account  with the Fourth Defendant  a copy of a document entitled  “2029 Client List.xlsx”. The file is 7MB in size and the Claimant says is  likely to contain a significant amount of information relating to City  Site’s clients.  The Claimant cannot presently access the file be cause it is  password protected and the First Defendant has not given the Claimant  the password.   iii) On 3 May 2023, the Third Defendant sent from his personal email to the  First Defendant’s  personal email account a spreadsheet including much  of the work output of Chloe Gladwin and Ben Pittman (the employees  of the Billericay office responsible for stand -alone and permanent  placements) and the contact databases from which they worked. The  Claimant says that the email was sent without the Claimant’s  knowledge  or consent  and that it is  reasonable to infer that the Third and First  Defendants  secretly transferred the information with the intention of  exploiting the sales opportunities to their and the Fourth Defendant ’s  benefit, but to the Claimant’s  detriment.  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 9 iv) On 14 and 21 June 2023, the First Defendant  sent from his personal  email to his email account  with the Fourth Defendant  details of sales  opportunities developed in the course of his employment with the  Claimant  in respect of the clients Archbell Greenwood and Ad vanced  Roofing . The Claimant says that the email was sent without the  Claimant’s  knowledge or consent  and that it  is reasonable to infer that  the First Defendant  secretly transferred the information with the  intention of exploiting the sales opportunities to his and the Fourth  Defendant’ s benefit, but to the Claimant’s  detriment.   v) On 20 June 2023, the Third Defendant  sent from his personal email to  the First Defendant’s  personal email account an updated version of  “Liam’s Plan.xlsx” document, which the First Defendant  in turn  forwarded to his email account  with the Fourth Defendant . The email  also attached a document entitled “LB Daily Bookings – NEW.xlsx”. Mr  Armitage describes the document as a daily planner, showi ng what  placements were live at the time and those that were upcoming. It was  an account of part of the branch’s work in progress. The Claimant says  that the email was sent without the Claimant’s  knowledge or consent  and  that i t is reasonable to infer that  the First Defendant  secretly transferred  the information with the intention of exploiting the sales opportunities  to his and the Fourth Defendant’s benefit, but to the Claimant’s   detriment.   vi) On 20 June 2023, the Third Defendant  sent from his personal email  to  the First Defendant’s  personal email account (in turn forwarded to the  First Defendant’s email account  with the Fourth Defendant  the next day)  an email giving the contact details, payment terms and supplier form for  Dearnside Fabrications. Dearnside Fa brications is a major architectural  metalwork company which the Claimant says it  brought on as a new  client in June 2023 and has three current assignments with them. The  Claimant also says that the email was sent without the Claimant’s   knowledge or consent  and that it is reasonable  to infer that the First  Defendant secretly transferred the information with the intention of  exploiting the sales opportunities to his and the Fourth Defendant ’s  benefit, but to the Claimant’s  detriment.   vii) On 26 June 2023, the Firs t Defendant  sent the login details for 15 City  Site email accounts from his personal email to his email account  with  the Fourth Defendant . The Claimant says that the email was sent without  the Claimant’s  knowledge or consent  and that the First Defendant  had  no claim to the accounts, which are the Claimant’s  property. The  Claimant further says that the only reasonable inference is that the First  Defendant  secretly transferred the login details with the intention of  harvesting information from the accounts fo r his and the Fourth  Defendant’s  benefit. The Claimant  has now changed the passwords but   says that it has no way of knowing what information had already been  extracted.   38. Mr. Armitage ’s witness statement  contain s details of  further evidence that the  Claimant relies on to show that the First and Fourth Defendants are actively High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 10 soliciting the Claimant’s  clients with a view to obtaining their business to the  Claimant’s  detriment.   39. Against, the background of the above evidence, th e Claimant says that it has  claims against the First and Fourth Defendants  in the following terms.   i) Against the First Defendant :  a) In respect of the pre -termination preparation to compete and  misappropriation  of confidential information: breach of fiduciary  duty, breach of the implied duties of fidelity, cooperation and  trust and confidence, breach of the express and implied duties of  confidentiality and breach of the equitable duty of confidence.   b) In respect of the team move: inducement of breach of  contract a nd unlawful means conspiracy.   c) In respect of the post -termination misuse and retention of  confidential information and competitive activity: breach of  the express and implied duties of confidentiality, breach of  the equitable duty of confidence, breach of the express PTRs  and unlawful means conspiracy.   ii) Against the Fourth Defendant :  a) In respect of the pre -termination preparation to compete and  misappropriation of confidential information: knowing receipt of  confidential information, inducement of br each of contract and  unlawful means conspiracy.   40. The First and Fourth Defendants deny that the Claimant has claims against them  as outlined by the Claimant. It is also right to note that the First Defendant had  had at the date of the hearing only limited ti me to respond to the detailed  evidential account put forward by Mr. Armitage in his witness statement.  Nevertheless, it is notable that the First Defendant has not, either in  correspondence or in his witness statement, sought to dispute  the account of  even ts as described in paragraphs 3 7 and 3 8 above or to offer any credible  explanation for those events.   41. Accordingly, I am satisfied to a high degree of assurance that the Claimant is  likely to establish its  claim s for breach of contract and duty against the First  Defendant and for breach of duty against th e Fourth Defendant.   Inference of dishonesty   42. The Claimant relied on various matters to invite me to infer that the First and  Fourth Defendants had been dishonest i n their dealings with the Claimant and  its representatives since this application was first intimated. However, i t is not  necessary for the purposes of this application for me to make any such findings  of dishonesty and I do not do so.  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 11 Principles for the grant of interim relief   43. There was a dispute between the Claimant and the First and Fourth Defendants  as to the principles I should apply when determining the Claimant’s entitlement  to injunctive relief.   44. The Claimant relied on the familiar American Cyan imid guidelines as laid down  in American Cyanimid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd  [1975] AC 396 , namely that it is  necessary for the Claimant to establish (i) a serious issue to be tried, (ii) that  damages are not an adequate remedy  and (iii) that the balance of convenienc e  lies in favour of the grant of interim injunctive relief .  45. In relation to each of the above guidelines , the Claimant submitted and I accept:   i) The test for a serious issue to be tried sets a low hurdle, which does little  more than exclude claims which might  be characterised as frivolous or  vexatious; see per  Patten J (as he then was) in BSW v. Baltec  [2006]  EWHC 822 (Ch).   ii) That on the issue of adequacy of damages, I should be guided by the  observations of Underhill LJ in Sunrise Brokers LLP v. Rodgers  [2015]  IRLR 57 at [53] :  In a case of this kind there are evident and grave difficulties in assessing  the loss, which an employer may suffer from the employee taking work  with a competitor ; even where it is possible to identify clients who have  transferred their business (which not always be straightforward,  particularly where the new employer is outside the jurisdiction) there   may be real issues about causation and the related question of the length  of the period for which the loss of the busine ss could be said to be  attributable to the employee’s breach. If the sums potentially lost are  large they will not be realistically recoverable from the employee in any  event … There may be other intangible but real losses to the employer’s  reputation.   iii) That in Lansing Linde Ltd v. Kerr  [1991] 1 WLR 251, the Court of  Appeal described the balance of convenience as an exercise in  identifying  the “lesser evil: will it do less harm to grant an injunction  which subsequently turns out to be unjustified, or to ref use one if it  subsequently turns out that an injunction should have been granted.”   46. I accept the Claimant’s submissions as to the approach I should take in applying  the American Cyanimid  test.  47. In contrast, t he First and Fourth Defendants submitted that to the extent the  Claimant was seeking mandatory relief, the principles to be applied were those  set out in the judgment of Chadwick J. in Nottingham Building Society v.  Eurodynamic Systems  [1993] FSR 468 at 474:   In my view the principles to be applied are the se. First, this being an  interlocutory matter, the overriding consideration is which course is High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 12 likely to involve the least risk of injustice if it turns out to be ‘wrong’ in  the sense described by Hoffmann J.   Secondly, in considering whether to grant a man datory injunction, the  court must keep in mind that an order which requires a party to take  some positive step at an interlocutory stage, may well carry a greater  risk of injustice if it turns out to have been wrongly made than an order  which merely prohib its action, thereby preserving the status quo.   Thirdly, it is legi timate, where a mandatory injunction is sought to  consider whether the court does feel a high degree of assurance that the  plaintiff will be able to establish this right at a trial. That is because the  greater the degree of assurance the plaintiff will ultimately establish his  right, the less will be the risk of injustice if the injunction is granted.   But finally, even where the court is unable to feel any high degree of  assurance that the  plaintiff will establish his right, there may still be  circumstances in which it is appropriate to grant a mandatory injunction  at an interlocutory stage. Those circumstances will exist where the risk  of injustice if this injunction is refused sufficientl y outweigh the risk of  injustice if it is granted.    48. The First and Fourth Defendant relied on these principles especially  in relation  to the Claimant’s claim for interim relief to enforce the PTRs  (and it seems to  me by association the claims for springboar d relief) .  49. For the reasons set out below, I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case to  grant the injunctive relief sought by the Claimant in a modified form whether I  apply the principles laid down in American Cyanimid  or whether I am applying  the ar guably more onerous principles in the Nottingham Building Society  test.  In other words, I am satisfied to a high degree of assurance that the Claimant  will establish its right at trial to the relief sought  (and by necessary corollary  that, if the appropria te test is one of a serious issue to be tried, then that test is  also satisfied) , that damages will not be an adequate remedy and that the balance  of convenience favours granting the relief in the form of the draft order, which  I have approved.  To the exte nt that the Claimant seeks mandatory relief, I am  satisfied that the risk of injustice is greater if I refuse to grant the relief than the  risk of injustice if I do grant the relief.    Threshold issues     50. The First and Fourth Defendants  raised threshold issues, which they say  precluded the grant of interim relief to the Claimant.   51. The threshold issues identified by the First and Fourth Defendants were:   i) That the Claimant was in fact seeking final rather than int erim relief on  the basis that any trial of the action would be unlikely to come on before  the expiry of the nine -month time term in the PTRs.  Accordingly, the  appropriate test for relief should be that for a final injunction, namely  the balance of probabilities . High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 13 ii) The need for the Court to have regard to the underlying merits of the  claims at an interim stage given the likelihood that no trial would come  on before the expiry of the nine -month term.   iii)  The failure of the Claimant to articulate its claims  either in the  correspondence or by the issue of a claim form and draft particulars of  claim.   iv) Short notice of the application and a failure to mention the undertakings  offered by the First Defendant and the Fourth Defendant.   52. The First and Fourth Defendants  also challenged:   i) Whether there was a contract of employment in place between the First  Defendant and the Claimant.   ii) Whether, even if the First Defendant was otherwise bound by PTRs, he  had a strong claim for constructive dismissal which would nullify the  PTRs.   iii) Whether the material relied on by the Claimant for the purposes of this  application had been obtained by unlawful access to the personal e -mail  account and personal data of the First Defendant.   iv) Whether a condition precedent to the enforcement of the P TRs was the  provision of a list of relevant entities and individuals with whom the First  and Fourth Defendants cannot do business.   53. For the reasons set out below, n one of the threshold issues raised by the First  and Fourth Defendants justify the refusal of interim relief in this case.   54. I have given directions for a speedy trial so it is not inevitable that the relief I  grant will be final. In any event, given  the evidence before me and the  submissions made, I am satisfied to a high degree of assurance, that t he  Claimant is likely to succeed in its claims, including the claim to enforce the  PTRs.  I do not consider that the present application requires me to go further  and be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Claimant is entitled to  the relief s ought . The authority relied on by the First and Fourth Defendants in  support of the proposition that I should be so satisfied, Re R -Squared Holdco  Ltd & Anor. V. MML Capital & Ors  [202] EWHC 23  (Ch) at [24] to [27] , is a  decision on a very different set of  facts and is not concerned with the  enforcement of PTRs. The judge’s conclusion that he should treat part of the  application before him as being an application for final injunctive relief was a  decision made on the facts of the case and does not purport t o set down  principles of general application.   55. Of more relevance is the decision of Edwin Johnson J. in Planon Ltd v. Gilligan   [2021] EWHC 3162 (Ch) , in which the Judge said  at [21] :  There is, however, an important addition or qualification to the application  of these principles in the present case. So far as Clause 17.1 is concerned, High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 14 the PTRs therein contained are, with one exception, imposed for 12 months.  It follows that the trial o f this action is likely to take place after the 12 month  period has expired or at a time when little of the 12 month period will  remain. It follows that the grant of an interim injunction based on the terms  of the PTRs which run for this period of 12 month s will have the effect of  granting to the claimant a substantial part at least of the substantive relief  which the claimant will, I assume, seek in this action. Even  if an order for  an expedited trial was to be made, it strikes me that not much of the 12 - month period would be left once the expedited trial had been finally  determined. In such circumstances, it is legitimate for the court to make  some assessment of the claimant’s prospects of success (see Staughton LJ  in Lansing Linde v. Kerr [1991] 1 WLR 251  [258] B -C]. Indeed Miss Bone  accepts on behalf of the claimant that the present case is a case of this  kind.”    56. The Judge went on at  paragraphs  [24] to [30] to make a preliminary assessment  that the claimant’s prospects of upholding the PTRs in that case were not that  good and therefore he was not prepared to gran t interim relief enforcing those  restrictions. It is clear from the judgment that he was not purporting to make  any final determination of the issues before him or to apply a test of balance of  probabilities. The Judge put the position in the following terms at [25]:   “So it seems to me , as I have said, that there is a serious issue to be tried  in this action. However, as I have already explained, I am also entitled  to make some assessment of the pr ospects of success of the claimant’s  case, given my views, on the effect of granting an interim injunction in  the terms sought by the claimant. I stress two points in respect of this  assessment. First, I am not making any final decisions on the claimant’s  case, nor am I saying anything which should be seen as binding the judge  at trial. Second, and mindful of what Staughton LJ said in Lansing, I am  only making some assessment. I am not making any in -depth analysis of  the claimant’s case and, indeed, in the absence of a pleaded case it seems  to me that it would be difficult to do so.”   57. When it comes to considering the individual aspects of relief sought by the  Claimant in this case, I will adopt the same approach as that taken by Edwin  Johnson J  in reliance on  the approach taken by Staughton LJ  in Lansing Linde  Ltd v. Kerr .  58. There is some force to the criticisms that the ability of the First and Fourth  Defendants to address the claims made against them has been made more  difficult by the failure of the Claimant to serve the Claim Form or to provide  draft Particulars of Claim , although the criticism that the Claimant has failed to  give full and frank disclosure is not made out . The Claimant’s answer to th ese  criticisms is that (i) the service of the Claim Form and draft Particulars of Claim  is not a pre -requisite to its’ applica tion and that (ii) it was concerned that the  nature of the claim and the parties to it might change as a consequence of this  hearing thereby requiring amendment of the Claim Form and revision of the  Particulars of Claim.  Overall, I do not consider that the  failure to serve the Claim  Form or provide draft Particulars of Claim so hindered the First and Fourth  Defendants in their defence that I should not grant interim relief. I am satisfied High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 15 that the First and Fourth Defendants knew the case they had to meet  and that the  Court can sufficiently identify the nature of the claims made for the purposes of  determining this application . Likewise, I consider that the criticisms made of  the Claimant’s articulation of its claims in correspondence does not assist the  First and Fourth Defendants. As an example, t he letter s of 07 July 2023 from  South Bank Lega l to the First and Fourth Defendants set out clearly the  allegations being made against both defendants.  As noted  at paragraph 5 above,  when I queried whether the y were ready to proceed or wished to seek an  adjournment, Ms. Husain confirmed that the defendants wished to proceed.   59. More critical for the purposes of this application is the  question of whether the  Court can sufficiently identify the terms of the First Defend ant’s employment.   The Claimant relies on the September 2021 contract as containing the relevant  terms of the First Defendant’s employment. The First Defendant states that he  did not sign these terms and that the contract does not reflect the terms of a  verbal agreement between Mr. Armitage and the First Defendant as to the terms  of an exit bonus if Mr. Armitage were to sell the Claimant.   60. The evidence before me on the terms of the First Defendant’s employment  contract can be summarised as follows :  i) The First Defendant was employed from  about  06 June 2018 as a  recruitment consultant on terms, which included both express  confidentiality obligations (cl. 17) and PTRs (cl. 19)  albeit in a different  form to those found in the September 2021 contract . Although the First  Defendant did not sign the contract itself, he signed the data protection  statement attached to it.   ii) The First Defendant was employed from about September 2021 or  possibly earlier as a Business Development Manager.   iii) The correspondence from September to October 2021 exhibited to Mr.  Armitage’s statement shows that apart from two amendments to the  September 2021 contract dealing with the date of commencement of  employ ment and how the First Defendant’s annual bonus would be paid,  the First Defendant did not take issue with the terms of the September  2021 contract. It appears from the correspondence that the First  Defendant’s exit bonus was to be the subject of a second contract.   iv) The First Defendant continued to work for the Claimant until the end of  June 2023. There is no correspondence in the period from September  2021 until June 2023 challenging the confidentiality obligations in that  contract (cl. 15) or the PTRs (cl. 16). During this period, there were on - going negotiations as to the terms of the First Defendant’s exit bonus.  It  is of note that the First Defendant continued to describe the terms of that  bonus as being a second contract  and that the draft contract which the  First Defendant sent Mr. Armitage was  headed as  a Deed of G ift/Bonus  Arrangement rather than being a revised contract of employment. The  same draft contract describes the First Defendant as an employee of the  Claimant.  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 16 v) The First Defendant recruited b oth the Second and Third Defendants to  work for the Claimant. Bot h were employed on contracts in similar terms  to those of the September 2021 contract.   vi) The First Defendant’s letter of resignation dated 30 June 2023 does not  raise any question as to the terms of his employment. It does refer to the  First Defendant not wo rking out his notice period.  The September 2021  contract provides for a four -week notice period at clause 1 2.1.2.  vii) The letter from Boddy Matthews on behalf of the First and Fourth  Defendants dated 12 July 2023 states that the September 2021 contract  does no t reflect the terms of the First Defendant’s employment and had  been varied since August 2021. However, it is of note that the only  changes mentioned are the salary and commission arrangements and that   the letter states :  a) In relation to clauses 4.1 and 4.2 of the employment contract, the  First Defendant worked tirelessly for the Claimant .  b) In relation to clause 12.1 of the employment contract, the First  Defendant was not obliged to give notice to the Claimant .  c) In view of his constructive dismissal, the First Defendant is  entitled to treat himself as discharged from any ongoing  obligations to the Claimant, including any post -termination  restrictions under clause 16.   d) That the First Defendant will give certain confidentiality  undertakings in relation to cli ents or potential clients as defined  in clause 16.1 of the employment contract.   61. The letter of 12 July 2023  does not suggest  on behalf of the First Defendant that  there were no PTRs in his contract of employment  only that he regarded himself  as being discha rged from any restrictions due to his alleged constructive  dismissal.   62. It is correct that during the correspondence in September and October 2021, the  First Defendant e -mailed Mr. Armitage on 20 September 2021 to say, among  other things, that he would not s ign the September 2021 contract without the  second contract. However, th e evidence before me shows that after  this date, the  First Defendant continued to work for the Claimant as a Business Development  Manager and that he did so on the terms of the Septemb er 2021 contract, while  continuing to try and negotiate a second contract dealing with his exit bonus.   63. I am therefore satisfied to a high degree of assurance that the Claimant is likely  to succeed at trial in establishing that the First Defendant was emplo yed on the  terms of the September 2021 contract which include the express confidentiality  obligations  and post -termination restrictions found  at clauses 15 and 16   respectively .  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 17 64. The First and Fourth Defendants also relied on circumstances, which they say  constitute unfairness, broken promises and threatening behaviour by Mr.  Armitage and the extraction of funds from the First Defendant without a  justifiable basis  as justifying the First Defendant’s claim to have been  constructively dismissed . The evidence i n support of the First and Fourth  Defendants’ case in this regard was set out in the witness statement of the First  Defendant  but is contested by Mr. Armitage and the Claimant . Bearing in mind  that this is an interim application,  I cannot and do not make any final findings  of fact as to the events, which are said by the First Defendant to justify him  considering that he has been constructively dismissed.   65. The Claimant says that , given  the evidence that the First, Second and Third  Defe ndants planned a ‘team move’ taking with them confidential information  and documents belonging to the Claimant, I should treat the First Defendant’s  allegations as being a self -serving attempt to avoid the effect of the express  PTRs.  There is considerable  force in this submission.   66. Further, even taking the First Defendant’s evidence at face -value , there remains  sufficient uncertainty as to the strength of that evidence when measured against  the evidence of Mr. Armitage  that I am not persuaded that  the First  and Fourth  Defendants’ case on constructive dismissal should override the degree of  assurance , which  I otherwise have that the Claimant will made good its case on  the terms of the First Defendant’s contract of employment and the enforceability  of the PTRs . In this regard, I do not consider that the evidence so far put forward  by the  First Defendant will enable the First Defendant to establish at trial an  irretrievable breakdown in his relationship with the Claimant and Mr. Armitage.   The evidence does show discussions between the Mr. Armitage and the First  Defendant about expenses, which were being charged to the First Defendant and  about the commission structure for the First Defendant. They also show  discussions about the terms of any exit bonus and it is fair to say an apparent  degree of reluctance on the part  of Mr. Armitage to sign or discuss the bonus  contract put forward by the First Defendant. However, I do not accept the  characterisation of that evidence in the skeleton argument served on behalf of  the First Defendant  as showing that the First Defendant was ‘forced by threats  and induced by promises into accepting disadvantageous changes to his  commission stru cture which were effectively forced upon him’ . Overall,  the  evidence so far before the court does not establish  behaviour by the Claimant  which would suggest that his claim for constructive dismissal is sufficiently  strong at this time to undermine the assurance that I otherwise have as  to the  likelihood of th e Claimant succeeding at trial to establish  that there were  enforceable PTRs in the employment contract for the First Defendant.  In other  words, I am not satisfied that the evidence presently before the Court suggests  that the First Defendant has a compell ing case  as to:  i) Deliberate over -charging of expenses to the First Defendant or on -going   failures to pay him his remuneration properly, which would constitute a  fundamental and repudiatory breach of the employment contract ; or  ii) An irretrievable breakdown of the employment relationship between the  First Defendant and the Claimant .  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 18 67. The First Defendant also relies for his case on constructive dismissal on what  he describes as  the Claimant’s unlawful and potentially criminal access to the  First Defendant’s perso nal e -mail and personal data as justifying his claim for  constructive dismissal.  There is a clear conflict of evidence as to how the  Claimant came to be able to access the First Defendant’s personal e -mail  account. T he evidence of Mr. Armitage is that the Claimant’s IT consultant was  able to access the First Defendant’s account through an open browser window  on the First Defendant’s work computer. The First Defendant disputes that this  is what occurred and does not believe he left a browser window open.  Ultimately, it is not for me to reach any final conclusion as to how the Claimant  accessed the First Defendant’s personal e-mail account  or whether the  manner  by which the Claimant obtained  access justifies a claim for constructive   dismissal . However, even  on the First Defendant’s evidence, I am not persuaded  at this stage that there is sufficient evidence of unlawful conduct by the Claimant  that it would undermine the assurance I otherwise have as to the likely strength  of the Claimant’s case  for the enfor ceability of the PTRs . In this regard:   i) Mr. Northall points to clause 20 of the September 2021 contract  which  provides in terms:   “…  20.2 You acknowledge that calls that you make and receive using  our equipment, use of the e -mail system, use of the internet and any  social media platforms may be monitored and/or recorded by Us to  establish compliance with regulatory procedures, to prevent or detect  crime, to investigate or detect the unauthorised use of the company’s  systems, to ascertain compliance with the [ sic] Our practices or  procedures and to check that all communications are relevant to the  Company’s business. Accordingly, the [sic] You acknowledge that the  content of communications using Our systems will not be private and  confidential to You.”   ii) There is  force  to the Claimant’s submissions concerning the self -serving  nature of the First Defendant’s evidence  on this issue as well .  iii) The First Defendant pointed me to  s.1 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990  (unauthorised access to computer material) and to potenti al breaches of  the UK GDPR and  the Data Protection Act 2018  (as set out in the letter  from Boddy Matthews dated 26 July 2023)  as the basis for his allegation  that the Claimant had unlawfully accessed his personal e -mail account  and data . But these submissions were not developed by reference to the  relevant legislation,  authority or commentary.    iv) Overall, the First Defendant has n ot established any sufficient case that  the Claimant has unlawfully accessed his personal e -mail account and  personal data to persuade me either that he has a compelling case that  the Claimant has acted unlawfully or that such conduct would justify his  claim for constructive dismissal.   High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 19 68. The First and Fourth Defendants also rely on the Claimant’s unlawful conduct  to deprive the Claimant of injunctive relief on the basis that the Claimant does  not come to court with clean hands. I accept that in an exceptiona l case  a party  seeking equitable relief may deprive themselves of the right to such relief if  “they have put themselves beyond the pale by reason of serious immoral and  deliberate misconduct such that the overall result of equitable intervention  would not be an exercise but a denial of equity ” (per Hildyard J. in CF Partners  (UK) LLP v. Barclays Bank Plc  [2014] EWHC 3049 (Ch) at [1133]).   69. However, for the reasons discussed in paragraph 6 7 above, I do not consider  that the First Defendant’s evidence does esta blish a case of serious immoral and  deliberate misconduct on the part of the Claimant such as to deprive the  Claimant exceptionally of its right to equitable relief. This is particularly the  case in circumstances where the evidence appear s to show delibera te steps on  the part of the First Defendant prior to his resignation to take confidential  information and data from the Claimant and no sufficient explanation (even at  this interlocutory stage) has been provided for the First Defendant’s actions.   70. Finally, the First and Fourth Defendants suggest that the terms of the PTRs are  so wide that they cannot comply with them without detailed lists of the entities  with whom neither Defendant must be engaged or concerned to do business  with.   71. For reasons set out below in relation to the orders I was prepared to make in  relation to the PTRs, I do not accept this submission. The definitions of Client,  Prospective Client, Candidate and Prospective Candidate found in Schedule C  to the draft order are not so complex that the First Defendant cannot easily know  with whom he is restricted from dealing not least because each of the relev ant  definitions limits the entities concerned to ones with whom the First Defendant  was material ly involved or had personal dealing during the relevant time perio d  (12 months for Candidates and Clients and six months for Prospective Client s  and Prospective  Candidates) .  Confidential Information   72. On the bas is that I reject the First and Fourth Defendants’ threshold challenges  to the relief sought by the Claimant, the defendants did not otherwise  specifically challenge the Claimant’s entitlement to orders in re lation to the use,  preservation and delivery up of confidential information and documents  in the  form found in the draft order, which I have approved.   Affidavit Evidence   73. The Claimant also sought an order for the provision of an Affidavit from the  First Def endant and an authorised officer of the Fourth Defendant in the  following terms:   “(13)  The First and Fourth Respondent (and in the case of the Fourth  Respondent, an authorised officer) shall by 16h00 on [insert date] each  provide an Affidavit to South Bank  Legal Limited setting out full particulars  of, respectively:  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 20 a. Their compliance with paragraph (12) above;     b. any Confidential Documents that each has in their possession or control  or have at any time had in their possession or control;     c. any Device or Account upon which each stores, or has at any time  stored, Confidential Information;     d. the use of Confidential Do cuments by them other than for the purposes  of their employment with the Applicant;     e. any person to whom they have provided Confidential Documents,  including: (1) details of the Confidential Document(s) supplied, (2)  when the Confidential Document(s) were supplied; (3) to whom the  Confidential Document(s) were supplied; and (4) the means by which  the Confidential Documents were supplied;     f. details of the steps taken by them prior to 30 June 2023, alone, together  with the First, Second, Third or Fourth Respon dents, or any of them,  and/or any other person or entity in relation to the establishment of a  business, in whatever form, to compete with the Applicant, including,  but not limited to, details of contact with Recruithub Platform Limited;     g. details of any Client, Prospective Client, Candidate or Prospective  Candidate that each have had contact with in connection with the Fourth  Respondent’s business at any time;     h. details of any approach or solicitation of any Key Employee, including  without l imitation the Second and Third  Respondent;     i. details of the password or other access credentials for all electronic  documents falling within the following description:      Computer file “2029 Client List.xlsx” ”    74. The Claimant justified the need for Affidavit evidence on the above terms on  the basis that it needs to know where its information has been stored, and the  extent to which the Defendants have divulged information to third parties, or it  has become integrat ed within the Fourth Defendant’s information management  systems.   75. The Claimant submitted that the purpose of the Affidavit evidence was to  support the primary provisions of the draft order, which aim to detain and  preserve relevant evidence, where ver it may  now be, and put the Claimant in a  position to limit future damage. The Claimant submitted that to achieve th at  aim, the Claimant needs and is entitled to know whom its information and  documents have been passed and by whom it has been used.  The Claimant  further submitted:  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 21 i) That the information required by the Claimant is proportionate to the  First and Fourth Defendants’ unlawful actions .  ii) That providing the disclosure affidavits should not be an onerous or  expensive task and there is no risk of any  statement by the Respondents  exposing or risking exposure of sensitive or personal information to  parties not entitled to it.   76. I accept that in principle the Court has jurisdiction to grant a disclosure order of  the type sought by the Claimant provided tha t the purpose of the order is to  obtain information which is required to either to assist in giving effect to the  injunct ive relief or to assist a claimant in undoing the harm, which has been  unlawfully done. However, I also take on board the warning  in Aon Ltd v. JLT  Reinsurance Brokers  [2009] EWHC 3448 (QB) at [ 26] (and also Le Puy Ltd v  Potter  [2015] EWHC 193 (QB) at [64] ) that a court must be careful not:   “… to subvert the normal accusatorial basis of our litigation, where the  horse precedes the cart, i nto an inquisitorial one  starting from an  assumption that guilt has been proved, and saying to the defendants, “Tell  us everyt hing you and others have done which was wrong” [when] all that  has been shown to date is a good arguable case, no more and no less  …”  77. For the reasons given by the Claimant, I consider  that this is in principle  an  appropriate case in which to make an order for Affidavit evidence from the First  Defendant and an authorised officer of the Fourth Defendant. However, I also  consider that sub-paragraphs (f) to (h) of the draft disclosure order set out above   were not required to assist in giving effect to the injunctory relief or to assist the  Claimant in undoing the harm, which has been unlawfully done . Rather, they  crossed the boundary  into requiring the Defendants to identify all that they had  done  which was or might be wrong. Accordingly, I grant an order for affidavit  evidence which required disclosure in accordance with sub -paragraphs (a) to (e)  and (i) of the draft set out above.   Enforcement of the PTRs   78. The Claimant sought orders enforcing the express PTRs found in the September  2021 contract against the First Defendant.   79. I have already found that I consider it likely at this stage that the Claimant  will  succeed in establishing that the First Defendant was employed on the terms of  the September 2021 contract (including clauses 15 and 16) at the time he  resigned from the Claimant.   80. I have also already found that the First Defendant’s case on constructive  dismissal does not establish grounds on which it would be appropriate to refuse  the Claimant’s application to enforce the PTRs.   81. The First and Fourth Defendant s challenge the PTRs on the basis that they are  too va gue and wide -ranging , both in scope and timeframe,  to be enforceabl e. I  do not accept that submission. In my view, the  PTRs are drafted in terms such High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 22 that the First and Fourth Defendants can know the restrictions which are being  imposed on the F irst Defend ant.   82. I accept that the ordinary remedy when seeking to enforce negative covenants  is an injunction ; D v P  [2016] ICR 688 .  In light of the evidence from Mr.  Armitage as to the financial position of the Claimant, I also accept that the cross - undertaking pr ovides protection to the First and Fourth Defendants against the  grant of the injunction if it is later proved to have been wrongly granted   (although the fact of the cross -undertaking is not a reason to grant injunctive  relief if it is not otherwise approp riate to do so ).  83. In deciding whether to grant the Claimant the relief it seeks, I adopt the guidance  of Haddon -Cave J. (as he then was) in QBE Management Services (UK) Ltd v.  Dymoke  [2012] IRLR  458 at [210] as to the general approach the Court should  take when considering the enforceability of PTRs.   i) The Court must determine what the covenant means, properly construed.   ii) The Court must then consider whether the former employer has shown  on the evidence that it has legitimate interests requiring protection in  relation to the employer’s employment.   iii) Once legitimate protectable interests are shown , the covenant must be  shown by the former employer to be no wider than reasonably necessary.   iv) Even if the covenant  is held  to be reasonable, the Court will decide  whether as a matter of discretion, the injunctive relief should in all  circumstances be granted having regard, among other things, to its  reasonableness at the time of trial.   v) The burden is on the covenantee to estab lish that the restraint is no  greater than reasonably necessary for the proper protection of  protectable interests.   vi) Reasonable necessity is to be assessed from the perspective of  reasonable persons in the position of the parties at the time that the  Contra ct was entered into or varied and having regard to the contractual  provisions as a whole and to the factual matrix to which the contract  would then realistically have been expected to apply.   84. Haddon -Cave J. was considering the test to be applied for final i njunctive relief.  Nevertheless, his guidance is still valuable when considering whether to grant  relief at an  interlocutory stage .  85. The relevant covenants at Appendix D of the draft Order  are as follows:   The [First Defendant]  shall not, without the [Claiman t’s] prior written consent,  directly or indirectly, either alone or with or on behalf of any person, firm,  company or entity and whether on his own account or as principal, partner,  shareholder, director, employee, consultant or in any other capacity  whats oever:  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 23 i) for three months following the Termination Date be engaged or  concerned in any business supplying Services in the Relevant Area;   ii) for nine months following the Termination Date and in competition with  the Company or any Group Company canvass or soli cit business or  custom from any Client, Prospective Client, Candidate or Prospective  Candidate in relation to Services;   iii) for nine months following the Termination Date and in competition with  the Company or any Group Company be concerned with the supply of  Services to any Client, Prospective Client, Candidate or Prospective  Candidate or otherwise deal with any Client, Prospective Client,  Candidate or Prospective Candidate in relation to Services;   iv) for nine months following the Termination Date solicit or ende avour to  solicit the employment or engagement of any Key Employee in a business  supplying Services (whether or not such person would breach their  contract of employment or engagement);   v) for nine months following the Termination Date employ any Key  Employee in a business supplying Services (whether or not such person  would breach their contract of employment or engagement);   86. The above covenants are to be read in conjunction with the definitions at  Appendix C to  the draft Order.  They provided so far as material:   Candidate  means an applicant for permanent employment, temporary or  contract work who has at any time during the Relevant Period been registered  with [the Claimant]  or any Group Company and with whom the [First  Defendant]  was materially involved or had personal dealings with during the  Relevant Period.   Client  means any person, firm, company or entity which has at any time during  the Relevant Period been a client of [the Claimant]  or any Group Company and  with whom the [First Defendant] was materia lly involved or had personal  dealings during the Relevant period.   Key Employee  means any person who immediately prior to the Termination  Date was a recruitment consultant / manager / Employee of [the Claimant]  or  any Group Company with whom the [First Defe ndant]  had personal dealings  during the Relevant Period.   Prospective Candidate  means any person, firm, company or entity who has at  any time during the period of six months prior to the Termination Date been in  negotiations with [the Claimant]  or any Group  Company about their  availability for placement in permanent employment, temporary or contract  work and with whom during such period the [First Defendant]  was materially  involved or had personal dealings;   Prospective Client  means any person, firm, company or entity which has at any  time during the period of six months prior to the Termination Date been in High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 24 negotiations with [the Claimant]  or any Group Company for the supply of  services and with whom during such period the [First Defendant]  was  materially inv olved or had personal dealings;   Relevant Area  means within ½ a mile of any branch of [the Claimant]  or any  Group  Company at which the [First Defendant]  worked in the Relevant Period;   Relevant Period  means the period of 12 months ending on the Termination  Date.  Services  means services identical or similar to those being supplied by [the  Claimant]  or any Group Company at the Termination Date and with which the  [First Defendant]  was materially involved during the Relevant Period;   Termination Date  means 30 June 2023 in the case of the First [Defendant] .    87. The First and Fourth Defendants did not suggest that there w ere any ambiguities  with the wording of the PTRs, which made them unreasonable or which made  it impossible or difficult for the First Defendant to know the meaning of the  PTRs.  I consider that the meaning and effect of the PTRs is clear. The First and  Fourth Defendants’ principal criticism of the PTRs is that they are too wide and  the First Defendant would not know  which of potentially thousands of Clients,  Prospective Clients, Candidates and Potential Candidates he is restricted from  dealing with.   88. I do no t accept this submission. Each of the definitions of Client, Prospective  Client, Candidates and Potential Candidates requires the individuals or entities  concerned to be ones with whom the First Defendant has been materially  involved or has had personal de alings within the relevant periods. Those  qualifications seem to me to be ones which will enable the First Defendant to  know who he is restricted from dealing with  particularly in circumstances where  he was the person principally responsible for overseeing  the Billericay office of  the Claimant  and building up its business.  In addition , I refuse to make on an  interim basis the order for deletion and destruction of Confidential Documents  or Relevant Documents sought by the Claimant . Not only does it seem to m e to  be an order which is effectively final in form, but refusal of the order will ensure   that documents are not  deleted or destr oyed which may be necessary for the  First Defendant to know whether he is at risk of breaching the terms of the PTRs   or to seek  legal advice  if necessary .    89. So far as the question of legitimate interest is concerned, as outlined in  paragraphs 33 to 36 above, I accept that the Claimant is likely to be able to  establish at trial that it has a legitimate interest, which require prote ction in  relation to the employment of the First Defendant  by the enforcement of the  PTRs .  90. As to the question of whether the PTRs are no wider than is  reasonably   necessary , I am satisfied that the Claimant is likely to be able to establish at trial  that the PTRs are no wider than reasonably necessary. The evidence of Mr. High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 25 Armitage is that the average life of assignment handled by the Billericay office  was six months but coul d be up to five years. The First Defendant disputed these  estimates and suggested that in relation to certain categories of worker the  length of assignment  could be measured in days.  However, I am satisfied at this  stage that there is sufficient credibilit y to the evidence of Mr. Armitage that  justifies a conclusion that the Claimant is likely to be able to establish at trial  that a restriction of nine months is reasonabl y necessary  and proportionate. I  take into account also the evidence from Mr. Armitage that with the departure  of the First, Second and Third Defendants , the Claimant’s Billericay office will  need time to re -establish itself especially in circumstances where the re is  evidence that confidential information and documents belonging to the  Claim ant have been taken by the First to Third Defendants. Although the  question of reasonable necessity is to be assessed at the time of contract, it seems  to me that the possibility of a ‘team move’ involving the First Defendant and  the possibility of confide ntial information and documents being taken are  possibilities which were foreseeable at the time of contracting and are one which  justify the necessity of the PTRs found in the September 2021 contract.   91. In relation to the exercise of my discretion and the b alance of convenience, I  take on board the submissions made on behalf of the First Defendant that he  should not be prevented from carrying on business as a recruitment consultant  in the construction industry and the evidence that he has incurred costs  associated with the start -up of his new business, including on -going costs  as  well as having costs of living including a mortgage. Nevertheless, it is also clear  that since 2018, he has worked for the Claimant under a contract of employment  which included post -termination restrictions and that the Claimant is likely to  be able to establish at trial that since about September 2021 he has worked under  the terms of the PTRs. Given that I accept that the Claimant is likely to be able  to establish at trial that the PTRs are reasonably necessary and the Claimant has  a legitimate interest to protect  and I accept that the PTRs as ordered do not have  the effect of preventing the First Defendant from working as a recruitment  consultant in the construction industry general ly, I find that the balance of  convenience lies in enforcing the PTRs at this time on the terms found in the  draft order approved by me. Given the evidence from the First Defendant as to  his limited means, it is also clear that damages would not be an adeq uate remedy  for the Claimant if it is later successful in its claims against the First Defendant.   Device and Account Imaging   92. I am satisfied that a device and account imaging order in the terms sought by  the Claimant is necessary to provide the Claimant wit h the security it requires  to confirm that the First and Fourth Defendants have complied with their  obligations and in particular their obligations in respect of Affidavit evidence.   93. In this regard, the court accepted in Warm Zones v. Thurley  [2014] IRLR 9 71  that the overriding consideration was to identify the court involving the least  risk of injustice should it transpire that the chosen course was wrong. An  imaging order was granted because the order sought was a focused one intended  to secure the return , protection and security of the applicant’s confidential  information. Accordingly, the balance of convenience lay firmly with granting  the relief sough t. High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 26 94. In Arthur J. Gallagher Services UK Ltd v. Skriptchenko  [2016] EWHC 603 an  interim computer imaging or der was granted. The Court held that it “had a high  degree of assurance the claimants will be able to establish a claim of breach of  confidence at trial” , damages would be an adequate remedy, the claimants  could meet their cross -undertaking in damages and the balance of convenience  favoured the making of the order sought. The court also recognised:   “[60]  The claimants are entitled to protect their confidential information.  The defendants are not entitled to have it or to use  it. On the evidence before  me, I am not satisfied that the defendants can be trusted to seek out and  delete such material themselves, were they to retain it whether deliberately  or inadvertently.”   95. I accept that the reasoning  in Warm Zones  and Skriptchenko  is applicable to  this case and on the evidence before me  justifies the grant of an imaging  order.   I also accept that the order sought is not so intrusive as would suggest that the  Claimant is looking to harass or  unduly burden the First Defendant.    Accord ingly, I make an imaging order in the terms found in the draft Order  approved by me.   Springboard relief   96. In addition to seeking injunctive relief to enforce the PTRs, the Claimant also  sought springboard relief to prevent the First and Fourth Defendants tak ing a n  unfair competitive advantage from the unlawful use of the Claimant’s  confidential information.   97. In order to obtain a springboard injunction in a case concerning confidential  information, an applicant must show :  i) Unlawful use of its confidential infor mation.   ii) That the respondents thereby gained an unfair competitive advantage  over the applicant.   iii) That the advantage still exists at the date that the springboard relief is  sought and will continue to have effect unless the relief sought is  granted.   98. More gen erally, an applicant for springboard relief must meet the following  principles  (see the discussion in the QBE Management  case at [239] – [247] ):  i) The purpose of springboard relief  is to prevent the defendants taking  unfair advantage of the springboard, which a respondent has built up by  their misuse of information.   ii) Springboard relief must be sought and obtained at a time when any  unlawful advantage is still being enjoyed by the wrongdoer .  iii) The aim of springboard relief is to restore the parties to the competitive  position which they have each sought to occupy and would have  occupied but for the defendant’s misconduct.  High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 27 iv) Springboard relief will not be granted where a monetary award w ould  have provided an adequate remedy to the claimant for the wrong done to  it.  v) Springboard relief is not intended to punish the defendant for  wrongdoing. It is intended to provide fair and just protection for an  unlawful harm on an interim basis.   vi) The burd en is on the claimant to spell out the precise nature and period  of the competitive advantage.   99. As already noted, I have a high degree of assurance that the Claimant will  establish its claims for misuse of its confidential information against the First  and Fourth Defendants. For reasons already given, I also consider that damages  will not be an adequate remedy for the Claimant.   100. I also accept for the purposes of this interim application the Claimant’s case as  to the competitive advantage gained by the First a nd Fourth Defendant. A  recruitment business cannot develop a stock of reliable client and candidate  information overnight. Nor can it be done in a matter of weeks or months. It is  an on -going and long -term process that requires patience and significant  investment of resources. The information cannot be purchased off the shelf. The  data is dynamic and require s continual updating and refinement. Mr. Armitage  estimat es that client information taken for the benefit of the First Defendant and  the Fourth Defendan t was developed through three years of sales activity. He  also estimates that the candidate information taken cost the Claimant at least  £100,000 to create. While the First Defendant disputes the evidence of Mr.  Armitage, it seems to me that it is sufficie ntly credible that I can have a high  degree of assurance that it will be accepted at trial.   101. The Claimant alleges that the effect of the First Defendant’s misuse of the  Claimant’s confidential information and the circumstances in which the First,  Second and  Third Defendants came to resign from the Claimant give the Fourth  Defendant an unfair advantage because:   i) They have weakened the Claimant  by diverting the Claimant’s good will  to themselves and failing to promote the Claimant’s business.   ii) The Fourth Defenda nt has gained a ready -made team equipped with the  Claimant’s confidential information so that it can develop a competing  business proposition more quickly than would have been the case if they  acted legitimately.   iii) If the First to Third Defendants are permit ted to join the Fourth  Defendant, they will use confidential information and harm the  Claimant’s business.   102. Again, I accept that the Claimant is likely to be able to make good this case at  trial. As such I am satisfied that the Claimant  is entitled to sprin gboard relief in  principle. The  Claimant recognised that the springboard relief it was seeking High Court Approved  Judgment  City-Site v Baker        Page 28 was at the severe end of interim order. It was right to do so. In particular, I had  two concerns about the scope of the springboard relief sought:   i) It seems to me  that there is a considerable overlap at least in relation to  the First Defendant between the springboard relief sought and the  express PTRs.   ii) If I were to prevent the Fourth Defendant engaging or employing the  First Defendant, that would prevent the First Defendant from using the  Fourth Defendant as a vehicle for a construction recruitment business  in  any form.   103. In response to my concerns, Mr. Northall offered an alternative form of  springboard relief, which would be limited in time to one month after th e date  for provision of affidavit evidence or further order. This he submitted would  allow the Claimant to seek more tailored springboard relief, if appropriate, once  the Claimant knew the extent of any confidential information taken by the First  and Fourt h Defendant s.   104. I am satisfied that on this more limited basis it is appropriate to order  springboard relief subject to one further qualification, which is that the Fourth  Defendant should not be prohibited from employing or engaging the First  Defendant.   105. Accordingly, I grant springboard relief in the terms of the draft order approved  by me.   Directions   106. This is an appropriate case for a speedy trial . All remaining parties in the action  need to know  as soon as sensibly possible  to what final relief, if any, th e  Claimant is entitled  particularly in relation to the enforceability of the PTRs. If  I were in any doubt about this, that doubt was laid to rest by the decision of the  Court of Appeal in Mimo Connect Ltd & Ors v. Buley & Ors  [2023] EWCA  Civ 909  handed dow n on the day of the hearing in this case, in which the Court  said (at [9]) “In common with many, if not most cases, to enforce covenants for  a limited period by way of injunction, this case cried out for an order for speedy  trial.”  This is similarly such a case .  Conclusion   107. For the reasons set out above, I made an order at the conclusion of the hearing ,  the final form of which has been agreed between the Claimant on the one hand  and the First and Fourth Defendants on the other and which I have approved.  I  have held over the issue of costs as between those parties to be determined on  paper.
