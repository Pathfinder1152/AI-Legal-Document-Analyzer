1           Neutral C itation Number: [2019] EWHC 2099  (QB)       IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE    No. HQ1 8M0 0961   QUEEN’S BENCH  DIVISION    MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS LIS T    Royal Courts of Justice   Strand, London, WC2A 2LL     Date: 31st July 2019   Before:     RICHARD SPEARMAN Q .C.  (sitting as a Deputy Judge of the Queen’s Bench Division)     B E T W E E N :    WARRICK FENTIMAN   Claimant   - and -                                     RICHARD MARSH   Defendant      __________ ___________       Mr Jeremy Ree d (instructed by Kingsley Napley LLP) appeared on behalf of the Claimant .    The Defendant did not appear and was not represented.     Hearing date : 22 July 2019     __________     J U D G M E N T   RICHARD SPEARMAN Q.C. :    Introduction     1. This is the trial of a claim  for libel, brought by Warrick (“Rick”) Fentiman in respect of  4 publications which are said to be defamatory of him. Mr Fentiman was represented at  2   the trial, as he has  been throughout these proceedings, by Jeremy Reed. I am gratefu l to  Mr Reed for the balanced and sensible way in which he presented his client’s claim.   This included ensuring that I had in mind those parts of the Defence of the Defendant,  Richard Marsh , which remained in existence  – a large  part of Mr Marsh’s Defence  having been struck out by Order of HH Judge Parkes QC (sitting as a Judge of the High  Court) dated 21 June 2019 – and which provided the only indication of Mr Marsh’s  stance in answer to the claim , because Mr Marsh did not appear and was not  represented  at the trial .   2. It appears from a n exchange of emails between Mr Marsh and Mr Fentiman’s solicitors  that Mr Marsh was notified on 19 July 2019 of the time and venue of the trial . The  trial  began at 2pm on 22 July  2019 , and, in the absence of Mr Marsh – and, thus , of any rival  evidence, submissions or cross -examination of Mr Fentiman’ s witnesses – concluded  that same afternoon. In an email dated 17 July 2019 , Mr Marsh stated: “ Please  apologise  to the Judge on my behalf for my absence, and explain that I am n o longer  resident in the UK, and have no funds whatever to finance a flight to the UK to attend  court”.   3. Although 4 publications were sued on, it appeared to me that the claim faced potential  difficulties in respect of one of them because (a) that publicat ion made no reference to  Mr Fentiman by name and (b) no reference innuendo had been pleaded in the  Particulars of Claim in respect of that publication and (c) if, in order to plead the case  correctly, it was necessary for Mr Fentiman to seek permission to amend the Particulars  of Claim, an application f or permission to amend would need to surmount the hurdles  which stand in the way of applications which are made so late in the day, to say nothing  of having to be made without notice to Mr Marsh in the circum stances of the present  case. Ironically, Mr Marsh’s non -appearance may well have operated to his advantage   in this context . If Mr Marsh had been present  and represented , his advisers might not  have questioned the form of the pleaded case, and , even if they  had done so , the  argument that an amendment would cause  prejudice to him might h ave been hard to  sustain. Having considered these issues overnight, Mr Reed informed me that Mr  Fentiman had co me to the conclusion that an application for permission to amend  was  probably required, but had decided not to make any such application. It was explained  that this was on the basis that the other 3 publications sued on covered very similar  ground to the 4th publication, with the result that the exclusion of the 4th publication  would be unlikely to have any, or any material, impact upon the quantum of damages.   4. As a result of Mr Reed’s successful application before HH Judge Parkes QC to strike  out parts of the Defence and for summary judgment in respect of various aspe cts of the  claim, and as the judge stated in Fentiman v Marsh [2019] EWHC 1563 (QB) at [61],  the issues for trial have been narrowed, in respect of each of the (now 3) publications  complained of , to (1) meaning, (2) whether the publication caused serious h arm (see  section 1 (1) of the Defamation Act 2013: “A statement is not defamatory unless its  publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the 3   claimant”), and (3) if Mr Fentiman succeeds on those issues, the  measure of damag es.  In addition , I am fortunate to be able to rely on HH Judge Parkes QC’s exposition of the  background and aspects of the claim, which I state below substantially in his words.   Background    5. Mr Fentiman is  the Chief Executive Officer  of Specialist Hygiene  Solutions Limited  (“SHS”),  which  trades  under  the name  “Hygiene  Solutions ”. Among  its products  are  a system  known  as “Deprox” which  carries  out “surface bio-decontamination”  for  healthcare and commercial purposes, and an automated UV light disinfection system   known  as “Ultra -V”. Both  systems  are supplied  to NHS  hospitals.     6. Mr Marsh has  a history  of making  serious allegations against  SHS and  its directors.   He did not attend  the hearing  of Mr Fentiman’s application  before HH Judge P arkes  QC, who was informed (in similar fashion to what occurred in advance of the trial  before me) that Mr Marsh had sent an email to Mr Fentiman’s solicitor s saying  he was  no longer  resident  in the United  Kingdom  and would  not be able to attend  the hearing.     7. The brief history  behind  the allegations  on which  Mr Fentiman now sues is as  follows.     8. SHS issued proceedings against Mr Marsh on 25 August 2015 in respect of allegations   of defamation  and breach  of contract and  confidence.  Those  proceedings were   compromised  by a consent  order  in Tomlin  form  on terms  which  included  an  undertaking  by Mr Marsh  not to publish  any further  information  (whether  public  or  private,  true or false,  defamatory,  disparaging  or otherwise)  of or concerning  SHS, its  employees,  directors,  servants  or agents, or  its Deprox  product.  That undertaking was  in remarkably  wide  terms, but Mr Marsh  was advised by solicitors Birketts  LLP.     9. In spite  of that undertaking,  between  about  2016  and 2018  Mr Marsh p ublished a  large number of allegations on websites with the domain names deproxfraud.info,  ultra­  vfraud.info  and deprox -fraud.blogspot.co.uk , on YouTube,  via Dropbox and Twitter ,  and on Facebook,  by email,  and by letter  to delegates  at a conference  on Infection   Prevention  Control.  In broad  terms,  the published  statements  alleged  that SHS’s  products,  including  Deprox,  were  ineffective  and/or  dangerous,  and made  a number   of allegations  of dishonesty  and criminality  against  Mr Fentiman a nd other directors.     10. Those  allegations  were  alleged  to be in breach  of Mr Marsh’s undertaking to the  court.  By notice  dated  13 March  2018 , SHS applied to commit Mr Marsh to prison for  contempt  of court.  In the course  of the hearing  of the  application,  Mr Marsh  pleaded   guilty  to contempt  in respect  of 17 specimen  counts,  as they were described. A t the  same  time, he admitted  that all the other  publications  complained of in the committal   application  had been  published  by him in breach  of his undertaking  to the court.  Mr  Marsh  also apologised for  his breaches  of the undertaking.  Mr Marsh was sentenced  on 4   30 April  2019  to be committed  to HM Prison  Pentonville  for 8 months,  suspended   for 2 years  provided  that the undertaking  was not breached during  that period.     The allegations  which are now complained of in the present claim      11. As set out above, Mr Fentiman relies on 3 further statements as being d efamatory  of  him. Each of them relate s to a cyber -attack on Mr Marsh’s various internet platforms,  which Mr Marsh alleges had previou sly taken place. Mr Fentiman does not know  whether  any such attack did, in  fact, take place. Accordingly,  he is in no position to  deny that it did. Even if it did, however, Mr Fentiman’s case is that he (and, for that  matter, as far as he knows, SHS) had n othing whatsoever to do with it. Mr Marsh’s  defence s of truth and  to the effect that there was a pub lic interest in publishing  allegations to the contrary  effect have gone due to the Order of HH Judge Parkes QC.      12. In the Particulars of Claim, the deproxfra ud.info  blogsite is termed “the First Blogsite”  and the ultra­ vfraud.info  blogsite is termed “the Second Blogsite”.  The 3 publications  complained of are termed “the First Post” , “the Second Post”, and “the Third Post”.     13. The First Post was made on the Second Blogsite on 2 October 2017.  Mr Fentiman  complain s of the following  words:     Hack  backfires!     The illegal and cowardly cyberattack on whistleblower site  deproxfraud.info  and on the personal  Facebook  and LinkedI n  pages  of Richard  Marsh  have  only served  to draw  the attention   of the NHS, Public  Health  England  and the Health  and Safety   Executive  to the grubby  and unethical  activities  of Rick   Fentiman  and his minions  at Hygiene  Solutions  Ltd.    14. The pleaded  meaning  of the First Post is that Mr Fentiman was responsible  for  carrying  out an illegal  cyber -attack  on the F irst Blogsite  and on Mr Marsh’s Facebook   and LinkedI n pages.      15. The Second  Post was made  on 3 October  2017  on Twitter and Linkedln.  Mr Fentiman  complain s of the following  words:       Deproxfraud.info  is back!  The site was fully restored  this  morning, following  last week’s hacker  attack  by Hygiene   Solutions  Ltd.    16. These words  were  accompanied  by a photograph  of Mr Fentiman , which is pleaded to  have  been altered  by Mr Marsh “ to give the impression  that [Mr Fentiman] is the evil  emperor  from  the Star Wars  movies” .     17. The basis of this allegation is that the photograph depicts Mr Fentiman wearing a  hood and with bright red “bulls -eyes” for eyes. Further, t he word “HACKER” 5   appears prominently in large font and in red type across his upper forehead. For   readers un familiar with the Star Wars movies, I consider that the photograph   nevertheless suggests a demonic element  to the “HACKER” who is pictured .    18. The pleaded  meaning  of the Second  Post is that  Mr Fentiman is a hacker, who  carried  out an unlawful  hack  and cyber -attack  on Mr Marsh the previous  week,  the effect   of which  in part had been  to take down  the First Blogsite.     19. The Third Post was made  on 13 October 2017  on the First Blog site. Mr Fentiman  complai ns of the following  words:     Legal  action  taken  re cyber -attack     Legal  action  is being  taken  against  the directors  of Hygiene  Solutions   Ltd in connection  with flagrant  breaches  of the Computer  Misuse  Act  1990.  See:  https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/crossheading/  compute     20. The pleaded  meaning  of the Third Post is that criminal  charges  were  being  brought  against  the directors  of SHS,  including  Mr Fentiman , for carrying  out a cyber -attack  on Mr Marsh .    Mr Marsh’s pleaded Defence     21. With regard to the First Blogsite, Mr Marsh pleads (so far as material) that (a) this site  has a built in analyser that counts the number of times that it is accessed each day and  (b) between 1 October 2017 and 15 March 2018 (the d ay after the claim form in these  proceedings was issued) this site received approximately 7,200 visits.     22. This information  is relevant to the Third Post, which was posted on the First Blogsite.  However, it says nothing about the number of times that the Third Post was accessed  (save that, if it is right, the Third Post cannot have been accessed on more occasions  than the Firs t Blogsite was accessed, namely 7,200 times in the period pleaded). Nor  does it state the number of people who accessed the First Blogsite (because it may be,  and indeed it is pr obably likely, that at least some people accessed it on more than one  occasion ). Further, the Third Post was not removed until some months after 15 March  2018. This information therefore only covers some of the period for which the Third  Post was available to be accessed.     23. However, Mr Marsh also pleads that the First Blogsite records the number of visits to  each specific post, and that the exact number of visits to the Third Post amounted to 188  in total. This figure is unverified by a ny documents. However, it i s based on the  following profile of visits: 101 in October 2017; 8 in November 2017; 0 in December  2017; 66 in January 2018; 7 in February 2018; 6 in March 2018; 0 in April 2018.    6   24. The “spike” of 66 visits in January 2018 coincides with the date of the 4th publication  (on Facebook) , which Mr Fentiman is no longer pursuing. This provides some grounds  (which are necessarily limited and imperfect) for thinking that these alleged figures may  be right. If they are dependable, they suggest that the Third Post was accessed on  relatively few occasions during the period which Mr Marsh has chosen to identify, and  may not have been accessed at all thereafter.     25. With  regard to the First Post, Mr Marsh pleads that this was on the Second Blogsite,  which was much smaller than the First Blogsite and attracted fewer  viewers . He  suggests that on a “generous estimate” the First Post may have attracted approximately  half the number of views as the Third Post  attracted , that is to say about 100 views.     26. With regard to the publication of the Sec ond Post on LinkedIn, Mr Marsh pleads that  there are no statistics available as the Second Post was merely a link to external  content ,  but that statistics are available for another publication containing negative content  concerning Hygiene Solutions that h e published on 11 October 2017 (8 days after the  Second Post was published), and that this was clicked on a total of 184 times between  that date and April 2018. He pleads that there are “no grounds to claim that the Second  Post would have attracted signifi cantly more than this level of engagement on  LinkedIn”. He also pleads – supported by what he says are relevant screen shots – that  the Second Post “received no likes, no comments and no shares” and that “This  indicates a very low level of interest and eng agement”.     27. As to the publication of the Second Post  on Twitter , Mr Marsh pleads  that he has 108  Twitter followers, that Twitter keeps a record of all engagements with posts, and that  the Second Post received 46 engagements, comprising: 20 link clicks, 14 d etail  expands, 6 profile clicks, 3 re -tweets, 2 media engagements, and 1 like.     28. With regard to the photograph contained in the Second Post, Mr Marsh pleads that there  is no basis for the claim that this has been altered “to give the impression  that [Mr  Fentiman] is the evil emperor  from  the Star Wars  movies”. He pleads: “The image  depicts [Mr Fentiman] wearing a hood. A hood is a very common article of clothing  and has no obvious negative connotations – it is often associated with monastic  orders – see below [followed by a cartoon featuring monks].”        29. With regard to the meanings pleaded in the Particulars of Claim , Mr Marsh’s case is  that (1) t he pleaded  meaning  of the First Post is “substantially true” (i.e. t hat Mr  Fentiman probably was responsible  for carrying  out an illegal  cyber -attack  on the First   Blogsite  and on Mr Marsh’s Facebook  and LinkedIn  pages ), (2) the pleaded meaning  of the Second Post is also “substantially true” (i.e. that Mr Fentiman is  a hacker ), and  (3) the Third Post did not mean  that “ criminal  charges  were  being  brought” but instead  the words “legal action  is being  taken ” meant (as was in fact true) that Mr Marsh “had  discussed the hacking issue with lawyers, and researched the relevant case law  extensively preparatory to bringing a criminal charge”.    7   30. The Defence contains a quantity of material which Mr Reed relied upon in  aggravation  of damages. This material includes claims (a) that the reason why Mr Fentiman  has not  sued Mr Marsh  in respect of numerous other very serious allegations contained in other  posts is that those allegations are substantially true and (b) that Mr  Fentiman “is a liar  … has no hesitation in committing a crime if he thinks that he can get away with it  … is  motivated by greed and financial gain without any regard for the effects of his actions  on individuals or society at large … is dishonest … would not hesitate to take illegal  actions to destroy the websites that were damning him and his business – because he  has no social conscience or moral compass  … [and] is the only possible party that  meets all the se conditions [i.e. the conditions which it is s aid that the hacker of Mr  Marsh ’s sites must have met]”.     The evidence of the witnesses     31. In his witness statement dated 21 November 2018, Mr Fentiman states:   “… I will not attempt to quantify the harm caused by any particular post in this  witness statement. I do believe that the posts about which I complain in this  claim were harmful to my reputation.   I suspect that Mr Marsh has no money (which is what he has said), and so  what I really seek in this action is vindication by virtue of the action  succeeding and by virtue of the size of the damage award – albeit in the  expectation that I will never recover any of my legal costs, let alone any  damages awarded. This might be considered as some measure of the upset that  these particular allegations have c aused me. I believe that the allegations that I  complain of in this claim are allegations of a nature which are seriously  harmful to my reputation. I also believe that unless I take action, Mr Marsh’s  conduct is likely to continue.   Furthermore, I find it aggravating that the Defendant is using his defence of  this claim as a platform for repeating the multiple other outrageous allegations  that he has made against me and SHS.   … The seriously defamatory allegations  about which I complain have no  truth  in them  whatsoever, and I hope that the court will vindicate my reputation. ”  32. In his witness statement dated 3 July 2019, Tautvydas Karitonas, the Head of Product  Development at SHS, states:    “… As I have been at SHS since 2014, I know what it was like to work for  the  business before and after the Defendant’s allegations. I also worked with the  Defendant at SHS and was very upset about the allegations he made against  SHS’s products after he had left. However, as my role at SHS is to ensure the  product efficacy and to develop the products, I was able to reassure myself that  these allegations about SHS’s products were not factually correct. We had  evidence that the allegations were not true. However, I did not have any  evidence that the Claimant did not hack the Defen dant’s systems.   Prior to the hacking allegations being published, there was a lot happening at  SHS due to the Defendant’s other allegations and it was a difficult 8   environment to work in. However, from working with the Claimant, I  understood him to always b e truthful and do the right thing. I saw the Claimant  as a role model, as somebody I looked up to and learned from.   When the hacking allegations were published, the focus shifted as the  allegations were now directed at the Claimant as an individual and hi s conduct,  and not at SHS’s products or matters relating to SHS’s products . I was worried  that the Claimant had cracked under the pressure in trying to deal with the  product allegations in the proper and lawful manner, as he had been doing. I  had seen firs t-hand the immense pressure that the Claimant had been under.  SHS was his business and he assumed all of the responsibility for it. The  Claimant had spent a good deal of time trying to deal with the Defendant’s  product allegations, yet they remained online . I believed that it was possible  that the Claimant had taken an easy way out to bring the Defendant’s blogsites  down and hacked the Defendant’s systems. I think it is only natural that this  crossed my mind given the allegations. I was confused. I thought I knew the  Claimant and his character, and I respected him, but having seen the hacking  allegations I was no longer sure about him.   Before the cyber -attack, the Defendant posted on a routine basis and it seemed  nothing would stop his posts. I thought maybe  the Claimant had decided to  take matters into his own hands, being fed up with having the false allegations  out there on the internet, and dealt with this problem by choosing to hack the  Defendant’s systems in a desperate attempt to support SHS. This was a  stressful time.   I did not speak to anybody about the hacking allegations about the Claimant. I  decided it would be inappropriate, given my role, and because, as much as I  have come to know the Claimant by working for SHS, he is my manager and  the owner o f SHS. However, I do recall the Claimant bringing up the  allegations generally and explaining it was more of the Defendant’s  “nonsense” and other team members making clear the hacking allegations  were crazy, absurd and just another attack but on a personal  level.   The hacking allegations did have a professional impact on me. I have always  been ambitious and career driven and I was worried about my professional  reputation. If I decided to leave SHS, I was worried what opportunities there  would be out there fo r me and I was concerned that my CV would be taint ed  by the allegations … I did not want to miss out on the opportunity to work  somewhere because I had been tainted by working for SHS.   … SHS operates in a small, closed and niche industry. The allegations,  including the hacking allegations, would likely be known to the industry and to  SHS’s competitors. I would be extremely surprised if SHS’s competitors were  not aware of all of the allegations, and if they were not following them. I was  worried that the all egations would have a longer term impact on SHS and the  Claimant, and me professionally, due to circulation within this closed  industry. ”  33. The evidence of Eleanor Barnes, a Client Support Executive Assistant at SHS, was to  the like effect. In her witness st atement dated 4 July 2019 she said:   “In late September 2017, I became aware that the Defendant’s blog was no 9   longer online. A couple of weeks later I became aware that the blog was back  online, and I saw that the Defendant made posts claiming that he was t he  victim of a cyber -attack and that the Claimant was the perpetrator of that  attack.   I have been shown what I am told have been referred to as the First Post, the  Second Post, and the Third Post, in this claim. I recall seeing the First Post and  the Seco nd Post, but I do not recall seeing the Third Post. I particularly  remember the Second Post as it contained  a photograph of the Claimant’s face.   The First and Second Posts  made me feel a little bit unnerved and uneasy. The  allegations were scary.   … The hacking allegations were different to the other allegations levied at  SHS as they concerned the Claimant’s character and integrity, not just the  products which the employees had faith in.   I took the hacking allegations seriously and wondered whether the Cl aimant  had carried out the cyber -attack. The Defendant had been busy posting  continuously about SHS for the preceding year and the allegations of hacking  made me question why he would have chosen to stop now. I wondered what  the Claimant  had to hide as he had always said he would go down the  professional and legal route to deal with  the Defendant’s allegations. So as a  result of the allegation of hacking that the Defendant had made against the  Claimant, I thought that perhaps the other allegations might be true after all .  The allegation that t he Claimant had carried out the cyber -attack  made sense to  me, as I knew that the Defendant’s blog which made the allegations against the  Claimant and SHS had disappeared from the internet, and I thought the only  possi bilities were that the Defendant had taken it down himself, or that the  Claimant for SHS had taken it down. I could not think why the Defendant  would have taken it down himself, and when the Defendant accused the  Claimant and SHS that seemed to make sense to me.   In the office, the Claimant would often speak to me and I did wonder whether  he had hacked the Defendant’s accounts because he was trying to cover up  serious faults within SHS’s products. Whilst I don’t think that I behaved  differently towards the C laimant following the hacking allegations, I did feel  differently towards him and tried to keep him at arms -length. I was worried  that the allegations were true, or might be true. I was careful what I said  around him, and I listened carefully to the Claima nt for anything he said which  might confirm that the hacking allegations were true.   … The Defendant’s blog and the Defendant’s hacking allegations were  discussed amongst the other employees of SHS, both at work and at social  events. I know this because I h eard it.  The employees I spoke to, and heard  speaking, knew that the Defendant’s posts had been removed and the blame  pointed at the Claimant …    I know these posts alleging hacking made me question whether the allegations  levied by the Defendant about SHS ’s products were in fact true.   … By the time of the hacking allegations in October 2017, I had been working  at SHS for about two  and a half years and I had a good working relationship 10   with the Claimant. Despite this, the hacking allegations made me feel u neasy  and I was unsure whether I wanted to continue working for SHS.  By this point,  I thought I knew the Claimant, but was always questioning whether I really did  – which was not a nice feeling …”   34. Finally, very similar evidence was given by Tom Lister, Hea d of Sales at SHS in a  witness statement dated 5 July 2019 . This included the following :    “Impact of the Hacking Allegations on Myself   12. As explained above, I had confidence in SHS’s products and, accordingly,  could simply dismiss these allegations but the hacking allegations were  different as they concerned the Claimant’s ethics as an individual. I did  seriously question whether the hacking allegations were true and the  Claimant had done something unethical to remove the other allegations  that the Defendant  had put on the internet.     13. It was credible, as far as I was concerned, that the Claimant could have  carried out the cyber -attack - he had a motive given the amount of pressure  he had been under, and given his commitment to removing the allegations.  To add  to this, I later became aware that the Defendant claimed to have  evidence that the cyber -attack was carried out in Kings Lynn, which is  where SHS and the Claimant is based. To my mind, this strengthened the  Defendant’s position.     14. I was particularly concer ned about these allegations because hacking is  serious and if somebody is found guilty of hacking in this way (i.e. as a  corporate cover -up) then it could have hit the headlines. I knew that if  these allegations were true, it could be the end of SHS. I bel ieved a lot of  people would have seen these hacking allegations, either by reading them  themselves or having heard them passed on by word of mouth, and I  needed to think seriously about my own career.     15. Shortly after the hacking allegations were made by the  Defendant, I was in  a room with the Claimant and his brother, Mark Fentiman. We discussed  the allegations and the Claimant, and Mark, assured me that these  allegations were also false. I had no way of proving whether that was  correct, but I decided to sta nd by the Claimant and the company.     Impact of the Hacking Allegations on others in SHS   16. I am part of the management team and other employees at SHS knew that I  was standing by the Claimant. I do not recall any specific conversations  with other employees about the hacking allegations but I did pick up on  murmuring throughout the business after  the hacking allegations had been  made by the Defendant. I remember feeling that the dynamics of the team  had changed and there was an ill -ease within the workplace.   17. SHS is an SME and not a listed company. The Claimant is the figurehead  and CEO of the bus iness and, therefore, without him the future of the  business was seriously questionable as far as I was concerned. I was  worried about my job – I would be out of work if SHS did not survive. The  hacking allegations, therefore, placed a lot of strain on the  Claimant, and 11   on SHS’s management team (including me).     Impact of the Hacking Allegations on the PBCC Community   18. The Claimant was well respected within the PBCC [i.e. Plymouth Brethren  Christian Chrurch] community. Trust (including personal credibility a nd  integrity) is a major currency within the PBCC, and that trust can be  quickly eroded.   19. The allegations, both concerning SHS and the hacking, spread throughout  the local congregation, of which the Claimant and I are both part of. I  know that some of the P BCC community understood the pressure the  Claimant was under because of the various allegations that the Defendant  had been making about SHS, and I believe that some of them are likely to  have thought (as I did, initially at least) that the twig had finall y snapped.  By this, I mean that they are likely to have thought that the Claimant had  taken down the Defendant’s website having tried and failed to get the  allegations on the website taken down by other lawful means.    Impact of the Hacking Allegations on Clients, Potential Clients and  Industry Contacts     20. Through my role of Head of Sales at SHS, I was aware that our clients,  potential clients and contacts within the industry ( “Contacts” ) were aware  of both the allegations levied at SHS and the hacking alleg ations. For  example, the Sales Manager of our main competitor, Bioquell Plc,  contacted me to discuss the allegations. In addition, I knew that many  people were watching the Defendant’s every move and some would even  “like” the Defendant’s posts. I recall, prior to any meetings with clients  and prospects, having to prepare to be questioned about the allegations by  SHS’s Contacts as the majority would mention them.     21. Our Contacts were, for the most part, able to understand and disregard the  allegations which the Defendant levied at SHS and its products. For  example, we had senior figures in the industry that critically analysed the  allegations and discredited them. In addition, for those who were unable to  understand the allegations, the SHS team were able to respond defending  the product with technical and scientific arguments as we had faith in the  product.     22. The hacking allegations were different – I (and the SHS team) had no way  of disproving the hacking allegations – unlike the allegations about the  SHS pr oduct which I could answer with scientific testing and technical  explanations. I could not rebut the hacking allegations with technical and  scientific arguments like I could the other allegations, and it came down to  the Claimant’s word against the Defenda nt’s word.     23. I know that the Defendant’s allegations were also spread by word of  mouth. For example, I attended an appointment where I met the Head of  Sterile Services for Brighton and Sussex Hospital who had heard the  allegations and explained that they h ad been brought up at the region’s  Decontamination Committee Meeting. I was told that SHS could not be  trusted so the Trust could not do business with SHS. The same happened in 12   Sheffield, the Sheffield Trust became very cagey. I do not think these were  isolated incidents.”   35. In his oral evidence, Mr Lister confirmed  that the reference in paragraph 20 of his  witness statement to allegations which the Sales Manager of Bioquell Plc had contacted  him to discuss were “product” allegations, not the hacking allegations . He also  confirmed that paragraph 21 of his witness statement related to “product” allegations.  With regard to paragraph 22, Mr Lister stated:  “I've got no specific recollection of  people asking me directly about the hacking allegations”. Howev er, he also made clear  that, as people were interested in the allegations that Mr Marsh was making, he would  invite me to conclude that people outside SHS would have seen the hacking allegations  as well as the  “product ” allegations. With regard to paragrap h 23, Mr Lister confirmed  that he had no specific knowledge that the hacking allegations were spread by word of   mouth , but that he had co me across instances  where people  had not actually  looked at  Mr Marsh’s posts but had heard about what was in  them, and raised them with him.  36. In short, Mr Lister’s evidence, which I regard as being of most assistance in  determining the probable extent of both the direct and indirect (“grapevine” )  dissemination of the hacking allegations complain ed of in these proceedings, i s stronger  with regard to the “product” allegations than with regard to the hacking allegations.   37. At the same time, in my judgment, this (and other) evidence , which I accept, provides  a  sound basis for drawing inferences that both direct and indirect  disse mination was  extensive, highly damaging, and, in all likelihood, permeating and lurking underground.        Issue 1:  Meaning     Legal principles     38. In Koutsogiannis v The Random House Group Ltd  [2019] EWHC 48 (QB), in which  both sides were represented by very experienced specialist defamation practitioners,  Nicklin J stated at [10] -[12]:     “There has been no dispute as to the legal principles. They are well -established  and very familiar.     The Court’s task is to determine the single natural and ordinary meanin g of the  words complained of, which is the meaning that the hypothetical reasonable  reader would understand the words bear. It is well recognised that there is an  artificiality in this process because individual readers may understand words in  different wa ys: Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd  [1968] 2 QB 157 , 173D –E, per  Lord Diplock.     The following key principles can be distilled from the authorities: see e.g. Slim  v Daily Telegraph Ltd 175F ; Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd   [1995] 2 AC 65 , 70; Gillick v Brook Advisory Centres  [2002] EWCA Civ 1263  13   [7]; Charman v Orion Publishing Co Ltd  [2005] EWHC 2187 (QB)  [8]-[13];  Jeynes v News Magazines Ltd & Anor  [2008] EWCA Civ 130  [14]; Doyle v  Smith [2018] EWHC 2935  [54]-[56]; Lord McAlpine of West Green v Bercow   [2013] EWHC 1342 (QB)  [66]; Simpson v MGN Ltd  [2016] EMLR 26  [15];  Bukovsky v Crown Prosecution Se rvice  [2017] EWCA 1529 [2018] 1 WLR  18; Brown v Bower  [2017] 4 WLR 197  [10]-[16] and Sube v News Group  Newspapers Ltd  [2018] EWHC 1234 (QB)  [20]:     (i) The governing principle is reasonableness.   (ii) The intention of the publisher is irrelevant.   (iii) The hypothetical reasonable reader is not naïve but he is not unduly  suspicious. He can read between the lines. He can read in an implication more  readily than a lawyer and may indulge in a certain amount of loose thinking  but he must be treated as being a man  who is not avid for scandal and someone  who does not, and should not, select one bad meaning where other non - defamatory meanings are available. A reader who always adopts a bad  meaning where a less serious or non -defamatory meaning is available is not  reasonable: s/he is avid for scandal. But always to adopt the less derogatory  meaning would also be unreasonable: it would be naïve.   (iv) Over -elaborate analysis should be avoided and the court should certainly  not take a too literal approach to the task.   (v) Consequently, a judge providing written reasons for conclusions on  meaning should not fall into the trap of conducting too detailed an analysis of  the various passages relied on by the respective parties.   (vi) Any meaning that emerges as the produce of s ome strained, or forced, or  utterly unreasonable interpretation should be rejected.   (vii) It follows that it is not enough to say that by some person or another the  words might be understood in a defamatory sense.   (viii) The publication mu st be read as a w hole, and any ‘bane and antidote’   taken together. Sometimes, the context will clothe the words in a more serious  defamatory meaning (for example the classic “rogues’ gallery”  case). In other  cases, the context will weaken (even extinguish altogether) the d efamatory  meaning that the words would bear if they were read in isolation (e.g. bane and  antidote cases).   (ix) In order to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of the statement of  which the claimant complains, it is necessary to take into account th e context  in which it appeared and the mode of publication.   (x) No evidence, beyond publication complained of, is admissible in  determining the natural and ordinary meaning.   (xi) The hypothetical reader is taken to be representative of those who would  read the publication in question. The court can take judicial notice of facts 14   which are common knowledge, but should beware of reliance on  impressionistic assessments of the c haracteristics of a publication’ s readership.   (xii) Judges should have regard to the impression the article has made upon  them themselves in considering what impact it would have made on the  hypothetical reasonable reader.   (xiii) In determining the single mean ing, the court is free to choose the correct  meaning; it is not bound by the meanings advanced by the parties (save that it  cannot find a meaning that is more injurious than the claimant's pleaded  meaning).   As to the Chase  levels of meaning, see Brown v  Bower [17]:   They come from the decision of Brooke LJ in  Chase v News Group  Newspapers Ltd  [2003] EMLR 11  [45] in which he identifi ed three  types of defamatory allegation: broadly, (1) the claimant is guilty of the  act; (2)  reasonable grounds to suspect that the claimant is guilty of the  act; and (3)  grounds to investigate whether the claimant has committed  the act. In the lexicon of defamation, these have come to be known as  the Chase  levels. Reflecting the almost infinite capacity for subtle  differences in meaning, they are not a straitjacket forcing the court to  select one of these prescribed levels of meaning, but they are a helpfu l  shorthand. In  Charman v  Orion Publishing Group Ltd , for exam ple,  Gray J found a meaning of “ cogent grounds to suspect ” [58]. ”  39. Mr Reed also referred me to Stocker v Stocker [2019] 2 WLR 1033, in which the  Supreme Court gave guidance as to the correct appr oach towards ascerta ining the  meaning of posts and T weets on social media. Lord Kerr JSC said at [41] -[45]:   “[41]  The fact that this was a Facebook post is critical. The advent of the 21st  century has brought with it a new class of reader: the social medi a user.  The judge tasked with deciding how a Facebook post or a tweet on  Twitter would be interpreted by a social media user must keep in mind  the way in which such postings and tweets are made and read.   [42]  In Monroe v Hopkins [2017] 4 WLR 68 , Warby J at para 35 said this  about tweets posted on Twitter:   “The most significant lessons to be drawn from the authorities  as applied to a case of this kind seem to be the rather obvious  ones, that this is a conversational medium; so it would be  wrong to engage in elaborate analysis of a 140 character tweet;  that a n impressionistic approach is much more fitting and  appropriate to the medium; but that this impressionistic  approach must take account of the whole tweet and the context  in which the ordinary reasonable reader would read that tweet.  That context includes (a) matters of ordinary general  knowledge; and (b) matters that were put before that reader via  Twitter.”   [43]  I agree with that, particularly the observation that it is wrong to engage  in elaborate analysis of a tweet; it is likewise unwise to parse a 15   Facebook posting for its theoretically or logically deducible meaning.  The imperative is to ascertain how a typical (ie an ordinary reasonable)  reader would interpret the message. That search should reflect the  circumstance that this is a casual medium; it is in the nature of  conversation rather than carefully chosen expression; and that it is pre - eminently one in which the reader reads and passes on.   [44]  That essential message was repeated in Monir v Wood [2018] EWHC  (QB) 3525  where at para 90, Nicklin J said, “Twitter is a fast moving  medium. People will tend to scroll through messages relatively  quickly.” Facebook is similar. Peo ple scroll through it quickly. They do  not pause and reflect. They do not ponder on what meaning the  statement might possibly bear. Their reaction to the post is  impressionistic and fleeting. Some observations made by Nicklin J are  telling. Again, at para 90 he sa id:  “It is very important when assessing the meaning of a Tweet  not to be over -analytical. … Largely, the meaning that an  ordinary reasonable reader will receive from a Tweet is likely  to be more impressionistic than, say, from a newspaper article  which, simply in terms of the amount of time that it takes to  read, allows for at least some element of reflection and  consideration. The essential message that is being conveyed by  a Tweet is likely to be absorbed quickly by the reader.”   [45]  And Nicklin J made an equally important point at para 92 where he  said (about arguments made by the defendant as to meaning), “… these  points only emerge as a result of close analysis, or someone pointing  them out. An ordinary reasonable reader will not ha ve someone by  his/her side making points like this.”   40. The question in that case was what meaning the words “He tried to strangle me” would  convey to the “ordinary reason reader” of a Facebook post. In the present case, the  words complained of have clearer characteristics of being straightforward statements of  fact, and I consider there is less room for concerns about parsing and elaborate analysis.   Application to the publications complained of   41. The effect of Mr Marsh’s Defence is to admit that the First Post meant that Mr  Fentiman  was responsible  for carrying  out an illegal  cyber -attack  on the First  Blogsite   and on Mr Marsh’s Facebook  and LinkedIn  pages . I agree that it bears that meaning.   42. The effect of Mr Marsh’s Defence is to admit that the Second Post meant that Mr  Fentiman is  a hacker.  I agree with Mr Fentiman that it also means that Mr Fentiman had  carried out an unlawful  hack -attack  the previous  week  (although this of itself does  not make the meaning any more or less defamatory). As to Mr Fentiman’s contention  that the Second Post also meant that “ the effect  of [that hack and cyber -attack] in part  had been  to take down  the First Blogsite ”, I see no reason why, a pplying the legal  principles  summarised above , the Second Post should be regarded as meaning any 16   more than “the effect of Mr Fentiman’s hack -attack had been to prevent access to  the First Blogsite” . In my judgment, that is the meaning that the  Second Post bears.   43. As to the Third Post, in addition to the words complained of, this included the line:  “CYBER -ATTACK, DEPROX, HYGIENE SOLUTIONS LTD, RICK  FENTIMAN, UCLH”. Further, under the heading “Computer Misuse Offences” , the  Third Post set out the text of some statutory provisions. The Third Post also included  a cartoon (which features twice) of a man on horseback (depicted in the style of a  Texas Ranger) leading away a number of criminals (roped together, and each  wearing black and white horizontal ly striped garments). Although not forming part  of the words complained of, I consider that these contents form an important part of  the context. In my opinion, the Third  Post meant that criminal  charges  were  being   brought against  the directors  of SHS,  including  Mr Fentiman,  for carrying  out a cyber - attack on Mr Marsh . As not all persons who are arrested face criminal charges, and  as “An unvarnished allegation that a person has been arrested for a criminal offence  will ordinarily convey the imputation th at he has conducted himself in such a way as  to give reasonable grounds for suspecting him of that offence” (see Doyle v Smith  [2019] EMLR 15, Warby J at [115]), the meaning of the Third Post is more serious  than a Chase  level 2 meaning. It is saying, in effect: “there are very str ong grounds  to suspect  that Mr Fentiman is guilty of Computer Misuse Act 1990 offences”.   Issue 2 :  Did the words complained o f cause serious harm to Mr Fentiman ’s reputation?     Legal principles       44. I considered the applicable legal princi ples in Yavuz v Tesco Stores Ltd & Anor [2019]  EWHC 1971 (QB) at [54] -[58]. Mr Reed accepted that  I stated the law correctly in  those passages, although he submitted (and I agree) that the facts of that case were v ery  different from those of the present case.  In that case, if the alleged slander had been  published, it would have been published to no more than a handful of individuals, none  of whom knew the claimant, and some of whom would probably not have believed it. In  those circumstances, I conclude d that the claimant had not established  that, assuming  that it was spoken, the slander complained had caused “serious harm “to her reputation.       45. The meaning and effect of section 1 of the Defamation Act 2013 (“section  1”) were  considered by the Supreme Court in Lachaux v Independent Print Ltd [2019] 3 WLR  18, in which Lord Sumption JSC, giving the judgment of the Court, said at [14], [16]:     “… section 1 necessarily means that a statement which would previously have  been regarded as defamatory, because of its inherent tendency to cause some  harm to reputation, is not to be so regarded unless it “has caused or is likely to  cause” harm which is “serious”. The reference to a situation where the statement  “has caused” serious harm is to the consequences of the publication, and not the  publication itself. It points to some historic harm, which is shown to have  actually occurred. This is a propositio n of fact which can be established only by  reference to the impact which the statement is shown actually to have had. It 17   depends on a combination of the inherent tendency of the words and their actual  impact on those to whom they were communicated …   … Sup pose that the words amount to a grave allegation against the claimant, but  they are published to a small number of people, or to people none of whom  believe it, or possibly to people among whom the claimant had no r eputation to  be harmed. The law’ s traditi onal answer is that these matters may mitigate  damages but do not affect the defamatory character of the words. Yet it is plain  that section 1 was intended to make them part of the test of the defamatory  character of the statement.”   46. Accordingly,  whether a statement has caused  “serious  harm” falls to be established “ by  reference to the impact which the statement is shown actually to have had ”. Further,  that, in turn, “ depends on a combination of the inherent tendency of the words and their  actual impact on t hose to whom they were communicated ”.     47. Moreover , a statement may not be defamatory  even if it amounts to “a grave allegation  against the claimant” if (for example) it is “published to a small number of people, or to  people none of whom believe it, or poss ibly to people among whom the claimant had no  reputation to be harmed ”.     48. At the same time, the assessment of harm of a defamatory statement in not simply “a  numbers game” (see Mardas v New York Times Co [2009] EMLR 8, Eady J at [15]).  Indeed:  “Reported cases have shown that very serious harm to a reputation can be  caused by the publication of a defamatory statement to one person .” (Sobrinho v  Impresa Publishing SA [2016] EMLR 12, Dingemans J at [47]).      49. Other points that arise from the Sobrinh o case include the following:       “46  ….  [F]irst … “Serious” is an ordinary word in common usage. Section  1 requires the claimant to prove as a fact, on the balance of probabilities, that  the statement complained of has caused or will probably cause serious harm to  the claimant’s reputation …         47. Secondly, it is open to the claimant to call evidence in support of his case  on serious harm and it is open to the defendant to call evidence to demonstrate  that no serious harm has occurred or is likely to do so. However, a Court  determining the issue  of serious harm is, as in all cases, entitled to draw  inferences based on the admitted evidence …       48. Thirdly, there are obvious difficulties in getting witnesses to say that they  read the words and thought badly of the claimant, compare Ames v The  Spamhouse Project [2015] EWHC 127 (QB)  at [55]. This is because the   claimant will have an understandable desire not to spread the contents of the  article complained of by asking persons if they have read it and what they  think of the claimant, and because persons who think badly of the claimant are  not likely to c o-operat e in providing evidence …       Fifthly, as Bingham LJ stated in Slipper v BBC [1991] QB 283 at 300, the law  would part company with the realities of life if it held that the damage caused 18   by publication of a libel began and ended with publication to the original  publishee. Defamatory statements are objectionable not least because of their  propensity “ to percolate through underground channels and contaminate  hidden springs ” through what has sometimes been called " the grapevine  effect”  …”     50. In Doyle v Smith  [2019] EMLR 15, Warby J cited these passages with approval  at  [116]. Warby J went on to emphasise the importan ce of the point about inference, and  (among other things) approved at [117] the following words of HHJ Moloney QC in  Theedom v Nourish Training ( trading as CSP Recruitment) [2016] EMLR 10 :       “Depending on the circumstances of the case, the claimant may be able to  satisfy s ection 1 without calling any evidence, by relying on the inferences of  serious harm to reputation properly to be drawn from the level of the  defamatory meaning of the words and the nature and extent of their  publication.”     51. Although the Supreme Court state d the law differently from the Court of Appeal in  Lachaux v Independent Print Ltd  [2018] QB 594, the following passages from the  judgmen t of Davis LJ accord with the Supreme Court’s analysis of section 1 :      “72.       ….serious reputational harm is capable of being proved by a process  of inference from the seriousness of the defamatory meaning … there is no  reason in libel cases for precluding or restricting the drawing of an inference of  serious reputational  harm derived from an (objective) appraisal of the  seriousness of the imputation to be gathered from the words used.       73.  … The seriousness of the reputational harm is … evaluated having regard  to the seriousness of the imputation conveyed by the words  used: coupled,  where necessary or appropriate, with the context in which the words are used  (for example, in a newspaper article or widely accessed blog).       79. There may, for instance, be cases where the evidence shows that no serious  reputational harm has been caused or is likely for reasons unrelated to the  meaning conveyed by the defamatory statement complained of. One example  could, for instance, perhaps be where the defendant considers that he has  irrefutable evidence that the number of publishees w as very limited, that there  has been no grapevine percolation and that there is firm evidence that no one  thought any the less of the claimant by reason of the publication …”     52. In Dhir v Saddler  [2017] EWHC 3155 (QB), [2018] 4 WLR 1 , Nicklin J said at [55] :      “In my judgment, the authorities demonstrate that it is the quality  of the  publishees not their quantity  that is likely to determine the issue of serious  harm in cases involving relatively small -scale publication. What matters is not  the extent of publication, but to whom the words are published. A significant  factor is likely to be whether the claimant is i dentified in the minds of the  publishee(s) so that the allegation “sticks”  … 19   (ii)  A feature of the “sticking power”  of a defamatory allegation that has  potential relevance to the assessment of serious harm is the likelihood  of percolation/repetition of th e allegation b eyond the original  publishees (“the  grapevine effect” ) (Slipper v BBC [1991] 1 QB 283,  300 per Bingham LJ). In Sloutsker v Romanova  [2015] [2015] EWHC  545 (QB) ; [2015] 2  Costs LR 321 , Warby J said at [69]:   “… It has to be borne in mind that the assessment of whether  there is a real and substantial tort is not a mere  numbers game,  and also that the reach of a defamatory i mputation is not limited  to the immediate readership. The gravity of the imputations  complained of… is a relevant consideration when assessing  whether the tort, if that is what it is, is real and substantial  enough to justify the invocation of the English court's  jurisdiction. The graver the imputation the more likely it is to  spread, and to cause serious harm. It is beyond dispute that the  imputations complaine d of are all extremely serious.”   53. In the Dhir case, Nicklin J  held that the claimant had demonstra ted that publication of  an allegation  that the claimant “threatened to slit my throat ” which imputed to the  claimant the commission of the criminal offence of making a threat to kill , punishable,  upon conviction, by imprisonment , and which was published or ally to at least 90 people  at a Church meeting had caused “serious harm”  to the claimant’s reputation.      54. In the Doyle case, Warby J held at [121] -[122] that the inference could properly be  drawn of “serious harm” to the reputation of the claimant arising from the publication  online of the “Third Article”, which alleged that there were reasonable grounds to  suspect that the claimant had committed the offen ces of blackmail and sending  malicious and menacing communications  in connection with the proposed sale to the  claimant of land owned by a rugby Club and dec eiving members of the Club into voting  in favour of that sale , because (a) such an allegation “coul d hardly be described as  anything other than seriously harmful to reputation” , (b) the defendant’s evidence  “seem[ed ] to show that the Third Article was viewed on 69 occasions”, (c) “ Publication  on this scale is not trivial or insignificant ”, and (d)  the inference was not rebutted or  even significantly undermined by other evidence, or by the submissions for the  defendant. D uring the course of discussing these last matters, Warby J observed:     “It is commonplace for a claimant to adduce evidence that has … l imits [as to  the extent of publication], and the reasons are well -known: see Sobrinho  (above). Here, the claimant’s evidence in his witness statements for trial was if  anything more extensive than one might expect in all the circumstances.  During the trial , Mr Foster’s evidence that “many members” of the Club were  monitoring the Website was not challenged. In cross -examination he  elaborated: “Everybody in the Club knew about it. Everyone was talking about  it”.   …    The victim of a libel cannot ordinarily ide ntify all the publishees.   Further, as  [Counsel] points out, there is the “grapevine effect” referred to in Sobrinho. ”   20   Application to the facts     55. The main significant features of the 3 publicati ons in issue are as follows :  (1) The allegation s which formed the subject of the First Post, the Second Post, and  the Third Post were all grave, and had  an inherent tendency to cause serious harm.   In substance, the First and Second Posts alleged that Mr Fentiman was an illegal  cyber -attacker and hacker, and the Third Pos t escalated matters by alleging that  his illegal activities had become the subject of prosecution for criminal offences.   (2) The number of people to whom each of the First Post, the Second Post, and the  Third Post were published was sub stantial. Even on Mr Mar sh’s pleaded case,  taking matters up to April 2018 in each case, but also discounting the possibility  of a substantial number of repeat viewings by the same people, the Second Post  was published to approximately 184 + 46 = 230 persons, and the Third Post w as  published to  approximately 188 persons. Further, in accordance with Mr Marsh’s  pleaded case, there were , perhaps,  about 100 views of the First Post . Findings of  serious harm were made on lower figures  in both of the Dhir  and Doyle  cases.   (3) Substantial further “grapevine” dissemination is made out on the evidence  (including Mr Marsh’s pleaded case that the 46 engagements relating to the  publication of the Second Post on Twitter resulted in 3 re -tweets). Mr Lister’s  evidence is particularly te lling in this regard, because he explains, and I accept,  that the hacking allegations (which formed the subject of all 3 Posts) spread  through the PBCC community as well as th e community of SHS’s customers. I  would have been prepared to draw an inference o f substantial “grapevine”  dissemination in respect of each of the Posts even in the absence of that evidence.   Such percolation typically results from allegations like these on social media.   (4) The evidence shows that, far from people not believing the allegat ions, they were  so pernicious that even those close to Mr Fentiman who trusted and admired him   were deeply troubled by them , and serious ly concerned that they might be true.  This was partly for one of the very reasons pleaded by Mr Marsh, namel y that Mr  Fentiman had a motive for wanting to shut down platforms that “were damning  him and his business” (although Mr Marsh has no case  that Mr Fentiman was, in  fact, guilty of the wrongdoing alleged in the Posts, or any material wrongdoing).    56. For these reasons , in particular , I find that Mr Fentiman has established that the  requirement of “serious harm ” is satisfied in respect of each of the above 3 Posts.   Issue 3 : the measure of damages     Legal principles    57. I shall follow the approach of Nicklin J in Dhir v Sadd ler [2017] EWHC 3155 (QB),  [2018] 4 WLR 1 in gratefully adopting the following summary of the relevant  principles by Warby J in Barron v Vines [2016] EWHC 1226 (QB) :  21   “[20]  The general principles were reviewed and re -stated by the Court of  Appeal in  John v  MGN Ltd  [1997] QB 586 … Sir Thomas Bingham  MR summarised th e key principles at pages 607 -608 in the following  words:     “The successful plaintiff in a defamation action is entitled to recover,  as general compensatory damages, such sum as will compensate him  for the wrong he has suffered. That sum must  [1] compensate him for  the damage to his reputation;  [2] vindicate his good name; and  [3] take  account of the distress, hurt and humiliation which the defamatory  publication has caused. In assessing the appropriate damages for injury  to reputation the most important factor is  [a] the gravity of the libel; the  more closely it touches the plaintiff's personal integrity, professional  reputation, honour, courage, loyalty and the core attributes of his  personality, the mo re serious it is likely to be.  [b] The extent of  publication is also very relevant: a libel published to millions has a  greater potential to cause damage than a libel published to a handful of  people.  [c] A successful plaintiff may properly look to an awar d of  damages to vindicate his reputation: but the significance of this is much  greater in a case where the defendant asserts the truth of the libel and  refuses any retraction or apology than in a case where the defendant  acknowledges the falsity of what wa s published and publicly expresses  regret that the libellous publication took place. It is well established  that [d] compensatory damages may and should compensate for  additional  injury caused to the plaintiff’s feelings by the defendant’ s  conduct of the a ction, as when he persists in an unfounded assertion  that the publication was true, or refuses to apologise, or cross -examines  the plaintiff in a wounding or insulting way. Although the pla intiff has  been referred to as “he”  all this of course applie s to w omen just as  much as men.”   [21]  I have added the numbering in this passage, which identifies the three  distinct functions performed by an award of damages for libel. I have  added the lettering also to identify, for ease of reference, the factors  listed by  Sir Thomas Bingham. Some additional points may be made  which are relevant in this case:   (1) The initial measure of damages is the amount that would restore the  claimant to the position he would have enjoyed had he not been  defamed:  Steel and Morris v  United Kingdom  (2004) 41 EHRR  [37],  [45].     (2) The existence and scale of any harm to reputation may be  established by evidence or inferred. Often, the process is one of  inference, but evidence that tends to show that as a matter of fact a  person was shunned, avoided, or taunted will be relevant. So may  evidence that a person was treated as well or better by others after the  libel than before it.     (3) The impact of a libel on a person's reputation can be affected by:    22   (a) Their role in society. The libel of Est her Rantzen  [Rantzen v  Mirror  Group Newspapers (1986) Ltd and Others  [1994] QB 670 ] was more  damaging because she was a prominent child protection campaigner.   (b) The extent to which the publisher(s) of the defamatory imputation  are authoritative and credi ble. The person making the allegations may  be someone apparently well -placed to know the facts, or they may  appear to be an unreliable source.   (c) The identities of the publishees. Publication of a libel to family,  friends or work colleagues may be more ha rmful and hurtful than if it  is circulated amongst strangers. On the other hand, those close to a  claimant may have knowledge or viewpoints that make them less likely  to believe what is alleged.   (d) The propensity of defamatory statements to percolate thro ugh  underground channels and contaminate hidden springs, a problem  made worse by the internet and social networking sites, particularly for  claimants in the public eye:  C v MGN  Ltd (reported with  Cairns v   Modi  at [2013] 1 WLR 1051 ) [27].     (4) It is often said that damages may be aggravated if the defendant  acts maliciously. The harm for which compensation would be due in  that event i s injury to feelings.     (5) A person who has been libelled is compensated only for injury to  the reputation they actually had at the time of publication. If it is shown  that the person already had a bad reputation in the  relevant sector of  their life, that will reduce the harm, and therefore moderate any  damages. But it is not permissible to seek, in mitigation of damages, to  prove specific acts of misconduct by the claimant, or rumours or  reports to the effect that he has done the things alleged in the libe l  complained of:  Scott v  Sampson  (1882) QBD 491 , on which I  will  expand a little. Attempts to achieve this may aggravate damages, in  line with factor (d) in Sir Thomas Bingham's list.     (6) Factors other than bad reputation that may moderate or mitigate  damages, on  some of which I will also elaborate below, include the  following:   (a) “ Directly relevant background context ” within the meaning  of Burstein v  Times Newspapers Ltd  [2001] 1 WLR 579  and  subsequent authorities. This may qualify the rules at (5) above.   (b) Publications by others to the same effect as the libel complained of  if (but only if) the claimants have sued over these in another  defamation claim, or if it is necessary to consider them in order to  isolate the damage caused by the publication complained of.   (c) An offer of amends pursuant to the Defamation Act 1996.   (d) A reasoned judgment, though the impact of this will var y according  to the facts and nature of the case.     (7) In arriving at a figure it is proper to have regard to (a) Jury awards  approved by the Court of Appeal:  Rantzen  694, John , 612; (b) the scale  of damages awarded in personal injury actions:  John , 615; (c) previous  awards by a judge sitting without a jury: see  John  608.   23   (8) Any award needs to be no more than is justified by the legitimate  aim of protecting reputation, necessary in a democratic society in  pursuit of that aim, and proportionate to that ne ed: Rantzen ... This limit  is nowadays statutory,  via the Human Rights Act 1998.”   Mr Fentiman’s case     58. In support of Mr Fentiman’s claim for damages and aggravated damages, Mr Reed  placed particular reliance on the following points:    (1) The seriousness of the allegations, going to a core aspect of Mr Fentiman’s  reputation (factor [a] in John ).  (2) The fact that Mr Marsh asserted the truth of the libels and has refused to retract or  apologise, thereby increasing the need for an award of damage s which vindicates  Mr Fentiman’s reputation (factor [c] in John ).  (3) The fact that Mr Marsh’s assertion of the truth of the libels in his Defence  continued the injury to Mr Fentiman’s feelings (factor [d] in John ).  (4) The identity of the publishees, including in  particular the publication to those of  Mr Fentiman’s employees, members of his PBCC congregations, and colleagues  in the industry who believed the allegations.   (5) The propensity of the allegations in question to percolate.   (6) The tone of the Posts , including, i n particular, the doctored photograph of Mr  Fentiman in the Second Post with the super -imposed word “HACKER”.   59. So far as concerns the level of award, Mr Reed referred to (a) Cairns v Modi [2013] 1  WLR 1015, in which t he Court of Appeal up held an award of £7 5,000 (plus a £15,000  uplift for the way in which the proceedings had been conducted on the defendant’s  behalf) to a claimant w ho was accused of match -fixing in a tweet sent to about 65  people (albeit “almost certainly” comprising a “specialist [readership ], consisting of  those with a particular interest in cricket” - see Lord Judge CJ at [26]), and (b) Monroe  v Hopkins  [2017] 4 WLR 68, in which Warby J award ed £24,000 to a claimant who was  accused, in tweets, of condoning and approving of scrawling on war memorials and  monuments.  Mr Reed submitted that the allegation s in the present case were “ much  more serious than that in Monroe , suggesting that the award ought to be rather higher  than £24,000 ” and were comparable to the allegation in Cairns , although the extent of  the publication s in the present case was greater than that in Cairns , such that the  appropriate award of damages “might well be rather closer to £75,000 than to £24,000 ”.  Discussion    60. As Warby J  said in Doyle v Smith [2019] EMLR 19 at [131]: “The  authorities suggest  that the Court should have regard to other awards made by Judges and/or approved by  the Court of Appeal, in respect of comparable libels”. At the same time, as Eady J said 24   in Al Amoudi v Kifle [2013] EWHC 293 (QB) at [24]: “comp arable awards … are … of  limited assistance only because circumstances vary so much from one case to another”.   61. In the Dhir case,  Nicklin J awarded damages in the sum of £35,000 taking into account  a number of factors, including : (on the damage s-enhancing side ) that the seriousness of  the allegation would be likely to have a seri ous “sticking power” in people’s  memories,  resulting in the need to make some allowance for the “grapevine” effect , that the  claimant was present when the words complained of were spoken an d is likely to have  been acutely embarrassed and upset in consequence, and that damages had been  aggravated by the defendant’s persistent plea of truth, which had been maintained all  the wa y to and through a public trial;  and (on the damages -reducing side)  that the  claimant had resorted to violence an d threats of  violence in the past, and this conduct  was in the same sector of his reputation as the allegation made by the defendant.   62. In the Doyle case, Warby J  awarded damages in the sum of £30,000 in respect of the  “Second Article”, which was published on a “village news” website operated single - handedly by the defendant, had 242 views, and was held to bear the following meaning:   “There was very good reason to believe that the Claimant had been guilty of  participation in an attempt to defraud members of the Club of many millions of  pounds, by allowing the Club to issue what he knew to be false and deceptive  documentation about a proposed land sale and then, with a view to ensuring  the propos al went through, asking the Club not to correct it.”   63. In the present case, I  agree that all the factors identified by Mr Reed are relevant. I also  consider that some of the especially aggravating features of Mr Marsh’s conduct  include (a) that the 3 Posts w hich are complained of were published against the  background summarised above, and (b) particular features of Mr Marsh’s Defence, such  as that the reasons why Mr Fentiman is said to be the likely perpetrator of the hacking  in question included that he is a  “liar … [and] has no hesitation in committing crime …  is dishonest … [and] has no social conscience or moral compass”, and the  provocative  and unconvincing  plea that the photograph which forms part of the Second Post  was not  mischievous because “ wearing a  hood … is often associated with monastic orders ”.  64. In light of their considerable overlap and close proximity in time, Mr Reed invited me  to make one award in respect of all 3 Posts. In my judgment, applying the principles I  have identified and taking acco unt of all the factors m entioned, that award cannot be  less than £45 ,000, with an additional £10,000 for aggravated damages . Anything less  would fail to serve the relevant purposes, and in particular the purpose of vindication.    Injunction   65. Mr Fentiman al so seeks “An injunction restraining [Mr Marsh] from publishing any  words with the meanings complained of herein, or otherwise howsoever libelling [Mr  Fentiman]”.  This raises the question of whether there is a threat or risk of repetition that  requires an i njunction to prevent it. I n all the circumstances, including the background  against which the matters complained of in the present proceedings took place, and the  way in which Mr Marsh has conducted these proceedings, I consider that there are 25   sufficient g rounds for concern  that without the protection  of an injunction Mr Marsh  will repeat these or similar libels in future  to make it appropriate to grant an injunction .  Conclusion   66. Accordingl y, there will  be judgment for Mr F entiman for damages of £55,000 in respect  of all 3 material Posts. I will grant an injunction to restrain repetition. I will deal with  the precise terms of that injunction and with costs when this judgment is handed down.
