Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      LORD JUSTICE MALES :  1. The issue  on this appeal is whether a foreign state whose agents, located abroad, cause  spyware to be installed  remotely on the computers of individuals located in the United  Kingdom,  causing those individuals psychiatric injury  when they discover that the state  has been spying on them in this way, is entitled to immunity  from civil proceedings .  That depends on whether  the proceedings from which the state claims to be immune  are ‘in respect of … personal injury … caused by an act or omission in the United  Kingdom ’ within the meaning  of section 5 of the State Immunity Act 1978 .  2. Three issues  have been argued on this appeal:   (1) whether in such circumstances there is an act by the foreign state  in the United  Kingdom at all;   (2) whether immunity  is only lost if all the acts by agents of the foreign state take place  in the United Kingdom ; and   (3) whether psychiatric injury  is ‘personal injury’ within the meaning of section 5.   3. The judge, Mr Justice Julian Knowles,  decided these issues in favour of the claimants.  The defendant state, the Kingdom of Bahrain,  appeals.   4. Another case , decided by the same judge on materially the same facts  six months   earlier , was Al-Masarir v Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  [2022] EWHC 2199 (QB), [2023]  QB 475. The arguments  in that case overlapped with, but were not the same as, the  arguments in the present case.  In Al-Masarir  Saudi Arabia argued that  section 5 did not  apply  to acts done by a state in the United Kingdom in the exercise of sovereign or  governmental authority, but only  to acts of a private law nature. Mr Justice Julian  Knowles reject ed that argument. Saudi Arabia appealed, but the appeal was dismissed  before it could be heard  because Saudi Arabia failed to comply with an order for  security for costs . Bahrain does not advance this argument in the present case. In the  present case Bahrain  contends that psychiatric injury does not amount to ‘personal  injur y’ within the meaning of section 5. That was not an argument advanced by Saudi  Arabia in Al-Masarir .  The State Immunity Act 1978  framework   5. The legal framework within which the issues arise was common ground. Section 1(1)  of the S tate Immunity Act 1978 Act is headed ‘General immunity from jurisdiction’  and provides:   ‘A State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the  United Kingdom except as provided in the following provisions  of this Part of this Act. ’  6. The effect of this provision is that , in order for a state to be subject to the jurisdiction  of the courts of the U nited Kingdom , the proceedings must be of a kind specified in  sections 2 to 11 of the Act. If none of those provisions  apply , the court lacks jurisdiction.   7. Relevant for present purposes is s ection  5, headed ‘ Personal injuries and damage to  property’, which provides:  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      ‘5. A State is not immune as respects proceedings in respect of –  (a) death or personal injury; or   (b) damage to or loss of tangible property,   caused by an act or omission in the United Kingdom. ’  8. The burden of proving that the claim falls within s ection  5 as one of the exceptions to  the general immunity provided by s ection  1 lies on the claimants . This must be  established on the balance of probabilities as a preliminary issue: JH Rayner (Mincing  Lane) Ltd v Department of Trade and Industry  [1989] Ch 72, 193 -194 ( Lord Justice  Kerr) and 252 ( Lord Justice Ralph Gibson) . It was common ground between the parties  that the act or omission referred to in section 5 must be an act or omission of the state  or of those for whom the state is responsible.   The claimants’ case   9. The claimants, who describe themselves as pro -democracy activists, are prominent  members of the Bahraini opposition movement. The f irst c laimant , Dr Saeed Shehabi,  is a journalist and activist who is a lso the founder of a Bahraini political  party called Al  Wefaq. He has lived in the U nited Kingdom since 1973 . He was granted asylum in 1985  and British citizenship on 14th June 2002.   10. The second claimant , Mr Moosa Mohammed, is a Bahraini citizen, but has lived in the  United Kingdom since 2006. H e was granted refugee status on 7th August 2007  and has  been granted indefinite leave to remain here.  11. The claimants ’ case is that from around September 2011 Bahrain’s  servants or agents,  likely operating remotely from outside the U nited Kingdom , hacked – or infected –  their computers with a spyware program called ‘FinSpy’ whil e they and their computers  were in the U nited Kingdom ; that this amounted to harassment under the Protection  from Harassment Act 1997; that they suffered psychiatric injury as a consequence  when  they learned that their computers had been hacked in this way ; that this amounts to  persona l injury within s ection  5 of the S tate Immunity Act 1978; and therefore that  Bahrain  is not immune.   12. Spyware is a type of computer program which allows a remote operator to take control  of a target’s device (e .g. their computer or mobile phone) and then to use that device to  carry out surreptitious remote eavesdropping and surveillance of the target by the  collection and transmission to a remotely located server of video, audio and data. The  spyware program is usu ally deposited on the target’s device by the  target unwittingly  opening an infected email or attachment that has been sent by the remote operator .  FinSpy is one such program.   13. The claimants’ case is that the operation of that spyware resulted in the covert and  unauthorised accessing by Bahrain  of information stored on, or communicated or  accessible via , the claimants’  laptops. This has enabled Bahrain  to collect much, if not  all, of the data processed on the laptops, including messages, emails, calendar records,  instant messaging, contacts lists, browsing history, photos, databases, documents and  videos. It has also permitted Bahrain  to track the location of the claimant s via their Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      laptops , to intercept calls made on them , and to eavesdrop  on the claimants by covert  use of the laptops’ microphones and cameras .  14. Bahrain  denies the claimants’ allegations, but the judge found , on the basis of expert  evidence, that the claimant s had discharged the burden upon them of proving on the  balance of probabilities that their computers were infected by spyware by Bahrain’s   servants or agents. It will be open to Bahrain  to challenge that conclusion at trial,  but it  has not been challenged on this appeal.   15. It appears that the claimants learned  of the hacking of their computers in or around  August 2014 when WikiLeaks published on its website documents concerning  Bahrain’s  use of FinSpy  and an organisation called Bahrain  Watch identified the  claimants as targets of such hacking.   Harassment   16. The claimants  frame the case in the tort of harassment. The ingredients of that tort were  described by Mr Justice Nick lin in Hayden v Dickenson  [2020 ] EWHC 3291 (QB)  as  follows:   ‘40. s.1 Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (“PfHA”)  provides, so far as material:   “(1) A person must not pursue a course of conduct - (a) which  amounts to harassment of another, and (b) which he knows or  ought to know amounts to harassment of the other.   (1A) [omitted]   (2) For the purposes of this section …, the person whose  course of conduct is in question ought to know that it amounts  to … harassment of another if a reasonable person in  possession of the same information would think the course of  conduct amounted to harassment of the other.   (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to a course of conduct if the  person who pursued it shows –  (a) that it was pursued for the purpose of preventing or  detecting crime,   (b) that it was pursued under any enactment or rule of  law or to comply with any condition or requirement  imposed by any person under any enactment, or   (c) that in the particular circumstances the pursuit of the  course of conduct was reasonable.”   41. s.3 provides that any actual or apprehended breach of s.1(1)  may be the subject of a civil claim by anyone who is or may be  the victim of the course of conduct. Remedies in a civil claim  include interim and final injunctions and damages for “any Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      anxiety caused by the harassment and any financial loss resulting  from the harassment”: s.3(2).   42. s.7(2) provides: “References to harassing a person include  alarming the person or causing the person distress”; and in  subsection (3) (b): “A ‘course of conduct’ must involve, in the  case of conduct in relation to a single person (see section 1(1)),  conduct on at least two occasions in relation to that person.”  Conduct can include speech (s.7(4)).   43. A defendant has a defence if s/he shows: (i) that the course  of conduct was pursued for the purpose of preventing or  detecting crime; and/or (ii) that in the particular circumstances  the pursuit of the course of conduct was reasonable (s.1(3)).   44. The principal cases on what amounts to harassment are:  Thomas v News Group Newspapers  [2002] EMLR 4; Majrowski  v Guy’s and St Thomas’s NHS Trust  [2007] 1 AC 224; Ferguson  v British Gas Trading Ltd  [2009] EWCA Civ 46; Dowson v  Chief Constable of Northumbria Police  [2010] EWHC 2612  (QB); Trimingham v Associated Newspapers Ltd  [2012] EWHC  1296 (QB); [2012] 4 All ER 717; Hayes v Willoughby  [2013] 1  WLR 935; R v Smith  [2013] 1 WLR  1399; Law Society v  Kordowski  [2014] EMLR 2; Merlin Entertainments LPC v  Cave   [2015] EMLR 3; Levi v Bates  [2016] QB 91; Hourani v Thomson   [2017] EWHC 432 (QB); Khan v Khan  [2018] EWHC 241 (QB);  Hilson v Crown Prosec ution Service  [2019] EWHC  1110  (Admin); and Sube v News Group Newspapers Ltd  [2020]  EMLR 25. From these cases, I extract the following principles   i) Harassment is an ordinary English word with a well  understood meaning: it is a persistent and deliberate course of  unacceptable and oppressive conduct, targeted at another  person, which is calculated to and does cause that person  alarm, fear or distress ; “a persistent and deliberate course of  targeted oppression”: Hayes v Willoughby  [1], [12] per Lord  Sumption.   ii) The behaviour said to amount to harassment must reach a  level of seriousness passing beyond irritations, annoyances,  even a measure of upset, that arise occasionally in  everybody’s day -to-day dealings with other people. The  conduct must cross the bound ary between that which is  unattractive, even unreasonable, and conduct which is  oppressive and unacceptable. To cross the border from the  regrettable to the objectionable, the gravity of the misconduct  must be of an order which would sustain criminal liabi lity  under s.2: Majrowski  [30] per Lord Nicholls; Dowson  [142]  per Simon J; Hourani  [139] -[140] per Warby J; see also Conn  -v- Sunderland City Council  [2007] EWCA Civ 1492 [12] per  Gage LJ. A course of conduct must be grave before the Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      offence or tort of harassment is proved: Ferguson v  British  Gas Trading Ltd  [17] per Jacob LJ.   iii) The provision, in s.7(2) PfHA, that “references to  harassing a person include alarming the person or causing the  person distress” is not a definition of the tort and it is not  exhaustive. It is merely guidance as to one element of it:  Hourani  [138] per Warby J. It does not follow that any course  of conduct which causes alarm or distress therefore amounts  to harassment; that would be illogical and produce perverse  results: R v Smith  [24] per Toulson LJ.   iv) s.1(2) provides that the person whose course of conduct is  in question ought to know that it involves harassment of  another if a reasonable person in possession of the same  information would think the course of conduct involved  harassment. The test is wholly objective: Dowson  [142];  Trimingham  [267] per Tugendhat J; Sube  [65(3)], [85],  [87(3)]. “The Court’s assessment of the harmful tendency of  the statements complained of must always be objective, and  not swayed by the subjective feelings of the claima nt”: Sube   [68(2)].   v) Those who are “targeted” by the alleged harassment can  include others “who are foreseeably, and directly, harmed by  the course of targeted conduct of which complaint is made, to  the extent that they can properly be described as victims of  it”: Levi v Bates  [34] per Briggs LJ.   vi) Where the complaint is of harassment by publication, the  claim will usually engage Article 10 of the Convention and,  as a result, the Court’s duties under ss.2, 3, 6 and 12 of the  Human Rights Act 1998. The PfHA must be interpreted and  applied compatib ly with the right to freedom of expression. It  would be a serious interference with this right if those wishing  to express their own views could be silenced by, or threatened  with, proceedings for harassment based on subjective claims  by individuals that t hey felt offended or insulted: Trimingham   [267]; Hourani  [141].  …’  17. As appears from this summary, the fact s of the present case are some way removed   from a typical case of harassment. In the present case, presumably, if the hacking took  place as alleged, Bahrain’s  intention  was that the claimants would never find out that  their computers had been hacked , in which case they would never suffer al arm, fear or  distress as a result , and Bahrain  would continue to spy on their activities and  communications  while the claimants remained in ignorance . However, we are not  concerned with such matters on this appeal.  We must proceed on the basis that,  if  establishe d, and subject to the issue of state immunity, the claimants’ allegations will  entitle them to a remedy in the tort of harassment.   Principles of statutory interpretation  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      18. We are concerned with the scope  of section 5 of the State Immunity Act 1978.  The  circumstances  in which the common law , following the development of international  law, moved  from a near absolute principle of  state immunity  to a restrictive theory ,  distinguishing between ‘ acta jure imperii ’ and ‘acta jure gestioni s’, are well known.   The story is traced by the Supreme Court in Argentum Exploration Ltd v Republic of  South Africa  [2024] UKSC 16, [2024]  2 WLR 1259 at [ 17] to [22]. This was the  background to the 1978 Act.  19. However,  the Act did not attempt  simply to enact the restrictive theory of state  immunity as  it had so far developed, but provided what the Supreme Court in Argentum   at [25] described as ‘a new statutory scheme providing detailed and comprehensive  rules governing both adjudicative and enforcement jurisdiction in cases involving  foreign and Commonwealth states ’. Its long title is :  ‘An Act to make new provision with respect to proceedings in  the United Kingdom by or against other States;  to provide for the  effect of judgments given against the United Kingdom in the  courts of States parties to the European Convention on State  Immunity; to make new provision with respect to the immunities  and privileges of heads of State; and for connected purposes.’   20. That statutory scheme must be interpreted in accordance with  the usual principles of  statutory interpretation.  These have been authoritatively  explained  in the judgment of  Lord Hodge in R (O) v SSHD  [2022] UKSC 3, [2023] AC 255:   ‘28. Having regard to the way in which both parties presented  their cases, it is opportune to say something about the process of  statutory interpretation.   29. The courts in conducting statutory interpretation are “seeking  the meaning of the words which Parliament used”: Black - Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke Waldhof - Aschaffenburg AG  [1975] AC 591, 613 per Lord Reid. More  recently, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead stated: “Statutory  interpretation is an exercise which requires the court to identify  the meaning borne by the words in question in the particular  context.” ( R v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport  and the Regions, Ex p Spath Holme Lt d [2001] AC 349, 396).  Words and passages in a statute derive their meaning from their  context. A phrase or passage must be read in the context of the  section as a whole and in the wider context of a relevant group  of sections. Other provisions in a statute  and the statute as a  whole may provide the relevant context. They are the words  which Parliament has chosen to enact as an expression of the  purpose of the legislation and are therefore the primary source  by which meaning is ascertained. There is an impo rtant  constitutional reason for having regard primarily to the statutory  context as Lord Nicholls explained in Spath Holme , 397:  “Citizens, with the assistance of their advisers, are intended to  be able to understand parliamentary enactments, so that they can Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      regulate their conduct accordingly. They should be able to rely  upon what they read in an Act of Parliament.”   30. External aids to interpretation therefore must play a  secondary role. Explanatory notes, prepared under the authority  of Parliament, may cast light on the meaning of particular  statutory provisions. Other sources, such as Law Commission  reports, report s of Royal Commissions and advisory committees,  and Government White Papers may disclose the background to  a statute and assist the court to identify not only the mischief  which it addresses but also the purpose of the legislation, thereby  assisting a purp osive interpretation of a particular statutory  provision. The context disclosed by such materials is relevant to  assist the court to ascertain the meaning of the statute, whether  or not there is ambiguity and uncertainty, and indeed may reveal  ambiguity or  uncertainty: Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on  Statutory Interpretation , 8th ed (2020), para 11.2. But none of  these external aids displace the meanings conveyed by the words  of a statute that, after consideration of that context, are clear and  unambiguous a nd which do not produce absurdity. In this appeal  the parties did not refer the court to external aids, other than  explanatory statements in statutory instruments, and statements  in Parliament which I discuss below. Sir James Eadie QC for the  Secretary of State submitted that the statutory scheme contained  in the 1981 Act and the 2014 Act should be read as a whole.   31. Statutory interpretation involves an objective assessment of  the meaning which a reasonable legislature as a body would be  seeking to convey in using the statutory words which are being  considered. Lord Nicholls, again in Spath Holme , 396, in an  important passage stated:   “The task of the court is often said to be to ascertain the  intention of Parliament expressed in the language under  consideration. This is correct and may be helpful, so long as  it is remembered that the ‘intention of Parliament’ is an  objective concept, n ot subjective. The phrase is a shorthand  reference to the intention which the court reasonably imputes  to Parliament in respect of the language used. It is not the  subjective intention of the minister or other persons who  promoted the legislation. Nor is i t the subjective intention of  the draftsman, or of individual members or even of a majority  of individual members of either House. … Thus, when courts  say that such -and-such a meaning ‘cannot be what Parliament  intended’, they are saying only that the word s under  consideration cannot reasonably be taken as used by  Parliament with that meaning ”.’  21. I would add that section 5 of the 1978 Act  is expressed in plain and straightforward  language.  That language  is the primary source by which its meaning must be  ascertained.  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      22. Further, a s explained by the Supreme Court in General Dynamics United Kingdom Ltd  v State of Libya  [2021] UKSC 22, [2022] AC 318, at [59], the 1978 Ac t must  be  understood in the context of the twin (and equally important) principles  of international  law on which the law of state immunity  is based, summarised  in these terms by the  International Court of Justice in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v  Italy) [2012 ] ICJ Rep  99:  ‘57. T he Court considers that the rule of State immunity occupies  an important place in international law and international  relations. It derives from the principle of sovereign equality of  States, which, as Article 2, paragraph 1,  of the Charter of the  United Nations makes clear, is one of the fundamental principles  of the international legal order. This principle has to be viewed  together  with the principle that each State possesses sovereignty  over its own territory and that there flows from that soverei gnty  the jurisdiction of the State over events and persons within that  territory. Exceptions to the immunity of the State represent a  departure from the principle of sovereign equality  and the  jurisdiction which flows from it. Immunity may represent a  departure from the principle of territorial sovereignty and the  jurisdiction which flows from it.’   23. Beyond this, however, it would be regrettabl e if the true meaning of section 5  could  only be understood by reference to the substantial volume  of external material,  extending over more than 2,600 pages,  cited  in the course of this appeal.  Indeed, it is  notable that  in Al-Adsani v Government of Kuwait  (1996) ILR 536, Lord Justice Ward   said of section 5 of the 1978 Act that ‘the Act is as plain as plain can be’ , an observation  endorsed by Lord Bingham and Lord Hoffmann in Jones v Ministry of the Interior of  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  [2006] UKHL 26, [2007] 1 AC 270 at [13]  and [ 38].  24. Finally as to the general approach  to the interpretation of section 5, section 1  is  sometimes described as containing the general rule, to which the provisions of sections  2 to 11 are exceptions. But that does not mean that they should be interpreted  restrictively, in the way that (for example) a contractual exceptions clause would be  interpreted.  As Lord Sumption explained in  Benkarbouche v Embassy of the Republic  of Sudan  [2017] UKSC 62, [2019] AC 777:   ‘39. I do not regard these considerations as decisive of the  present issue. No one doubts that as a matter of domestic law,  Part I of the State Immunity Act is a complete code. If the case  does not fall within one of the exceptions to section 1, the state  is immune. But the present question is whether the immunity  thus conferred is wider than customary international law  requires, and that raises different considerations. In the first  place, it is necessary to read the grant of the immunity in article  5 of t he United Nations Convention together with the exceptions  which follow, as an organic whole. The exceptions are so  fundamental in their character, so consistent in their objective  and so broad in their effect as to amount in reality to a  qualification of t he principle of immunity itself rather than a  mere collection of special exceptions. …’ Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      25. It appears that Lord Sumption was speaking  mainly about the United Nations  Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property 2004  (‘the UN  Convention’) , but this court made clear in The Prestige (Nos. 3 & 4)  [2021] EWCA Civ  1589  [2022] 1 WLR 3434  that the same approach applies to interpretation of the 1978  Act:  ‘38. … we were not attracted by Mr Young’s argument that a  restrictive interpretation should be put on the scope of the  definition within  subsection (3)(c) because the structure of the  Act was one which provided immunity in section 1 and section  3(1)(a)  was an exception, thereby giving rise to a strict  interpretation of the exceptions if it was to be removed. We do  not accept that the structure of the Act provides any basis for  such a restrictive approach to construction of the exception  sections, for th e reasons articulated by Lord Sumption JSC in  Benkarbouche  at para 39.’   Ground 1 – Was there an act by the foreign state in the United Kingdom?   26. Bahrain’s first ground of appeal is that the judge was wrong to hold  that the alleged acts  of computer surveillance took place in the United Kingdom rather than abroad.   The judgment   27. The claimants’ pleaded case  is that Bahrain’s  acts in the United Kingdom included the  following:   ‘(1) Transmitting executable files for installing FinSpy on the SS  Computer and the MM Computer ("the Devices"), which were  at all material times located in England.   (2) Installing FinSpy on the Devices, including by overwriting  the hard disk and/or Master Boot Record with malicious code.   (3) Running the spyware on the Devices.   (4) Executing FinSpy to the Devices' Central Processing Units,  and reading data to, and writing it from, the Devices' Random  Access Memory.   (5) Storing information gathered by the spyware on the Devices'  hard disks.   (6) Using the Devices' computer network interface controller to  send and receive data via a wired or wireless network and  telecommunications equipment within the UK.   (7) Using the Devices' battery power to transmit and receive data  and commands, and to use other hardware components in the  Devices.  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      (8) Exfiltrating or causing to be exfiltrated information held on,  available from and/or transmitted via the Devices.   (9) Activating or causing to be activated the Devices'  microphones and/or cameras, and recording information with the  same.   (10) Recording and transmitting keystrokes and mouse  movements made on the Devices. ’  28. The judge held that remote manipulation from abroad of a computer located in the  United Kingdom is  an act within the United Kingdom. His decision did not depend on  the precise technical means by which this manipulation occurred, as detailed in the  claimants’ pleading,  but was more broadly based. He re lied on cases on  extradition ( R  v Governor of Brixton Prison, ex parte Levin  [1997] QB 65)  and jurisdiction ( Ashton  Investments Lt d v OJSC Russian Aluminium  (Rusal)  [2006] EWHC 2545 (Comm),  [2007] 1 All ER (Com m) 857 ), concluding that:   ‘143. I do not consider there is any meaningful distinction  between the facts of  Levin , where there was nefarious real time  manipulation from Russia of a computer in the US, and this case  of a spyware attack implanting software from abroad by trickery  onto a device in the UK, which then, at regular intervals under  the control of the spyware  program, sends data back to a C&C  server abroad. The technicalities may be different, but the  principle is the same. In both cases a foreign entity has taken  control of a computer located in the UK in order  to obtain data.   144. I therefore conclude that infecting a computer located in the  UK with spyware from abroad is an act done in the UK for the  purposes of s 5. ’  Submissions   29. Professor Dan Sarooshi KC for Bahrain  submitted that when a person located abroad   uses a computer to infect with spyware a computer in the United Kingdom, the act in  question is to be regarded as having taken place abroad and not in the United Kingdom  for the purposes of section 5 of the 1978 Act.  The act of hacking takes place where the  actor instigates it or conducts the manipulation, not where the target device is located.  In the present case, the claimants’ evidence is that the infection of the ir comput ers had  been carried out remotely by agents of the Bahraini government , probably  located in  Bahrain.  It is not suggested that the act s in question were carried out by anyone present  within the territory of the United Kingdom.  The judge’s  decision confused the act (what  the actor does to the computer located abroad) with the effects of that act (what happens  as a result to the computer located in the United Kingdom).   30. Professor Sarooshi relied  on the recent judgment of the European Court of Human  Rights in Wieder v U nited Kingdom  (2024) 78 EHRR 8 (Applications nos. 64371/16  and 64407/16), a decision not available to the judge  which, he submitted,  held that  an  act of surveillance comparable to the alleged hacking in the present case takes place Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      where the communications are intercepted and examined, and not where the victim’s  device is located.   31. He relied also on the Computer Misuse Act  1990 which, he submitted, recognises  that  when a person abroad secures unauthorised access to a computer in the United  Kingdom, the offending acts are committed abroad and not in the United Kingdom.  In  such a case, Parliament has provided in section 4 (2) that the United Kingdom courts  will only have jurisdiction if there is ‘at least one significant link with [the] domestic  jurisdiction’, a provision which would be unnecessary if the act in question  were  regarded as  having been committed here.   32. Mr Ben Silverstone  for the claimants submitted that  it was unreal to suggest that no acts  occurred in the United Kingdom.  The claimants had pleaded a series of acts taking place  here and it made no difference that other acts  had been performed by Bahrain’s  agents  abroad.  It was wrong to conflate the act and the actor, there being no requirement in  section 5 that the actor  had to be present within the United Kingdom.   33. Mr Silverstone submitted that the claimants’ interpretation  is supported by the  European Convention on State Immunity 1972 (‘ECSI’) and the UN Convention,  both  of which refer expressly to the location of the author of the acts, a point deliberately  omitted  by section 5  of the 1978 Act.  He relied also on cases concerned with jurisdiction  under paragraph 3.1(9) of Practice Direction  6B and on the cases cited by the judge .  Analysis   34. In my judgment, as a straightforward use of language,  the remote manipulation from  abroad of a computer located in the United Kingdom is an act within the United  Kingdom . The true position in such a case is that  the agents of the foreign state commit  acts both in this country and abroad.  To distinguish between what happens abroad and  what happens here, characterising the former as an act and the latter as merely the effect  of the act,  is artificial  and unprincipled. The reality is that a foreign state which  acts in  this way  is interfering  here with the territorial sovereignty of the United Kingdom.   35. I agree with the judge that what was said in R v Governor of Brixton Prison, ex parte  Levin  and Ashton Investments Ltd v OJSC Russian Aluminium (Rusal)  is helpful . That  is not because those cases set out any applicable principle of law . It would be dangerous  to incorporate principles of extradition law , or the procedural law governing service out  of the jurisdiction , into the very different context of state immunity , and for that reason  I did not find some of the other jurisdiction cases relied on by the judge of assistance.  Rather, they are helpful because they demonstr ate on comparable facts that to describe  the act of hacking as taking place here  is a natural and appropriate use of language.   36. In Levin  the applicant had used his own computer in St Petersburg  to gain access to a   United States bank’s computer at Parsipenny in the state of New Jersey , in order to  transfer funds into various bank accounts controlled by him.  The United States sought  his extradition  from the United Kingdom.  The applicant contended that the  appropriation of funds had taken place in Russia, where his computer keyboard was  situated, and that the English court therefore had no jurisdiction . The Divisional Court  (Lord Justi ce Beldam and Mr Justice Morison)  rejected this contention:  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      ‘For the reasons we have already indicated, the operation of the  keyboard by a computer operator produces a virtually  instantaneous result on the magnetic dis k of the computer  even  though it may be 10,000 miles away. It seems to us artificial to  regard the act as having been done in one rather than the other  place. But, in the position of having to choose on the facts of this  case whether,  after entering the computer in Parsipenny, the act  of appropriation by inserting instructions on the disk  occurred  there or in St Petersburg, we would opt for Parsipenny.  The fact  that the applicant was physically in St Petersburg  is of far less  significance than the fact that he was looking a t and operating on  magnetic disks located in Parsipenny.  The essence of what he  was doing was done there. …’   37. Similarly, the essence of what Bahrain’s  agents are alleged to have done  in the present  case was done in the United Kingdom where the claimants’ computers  were hacked.   38. Ashton Investments  involved a claim for breach of confidence, unlawful interference  with business and conspiracy.  The allegation was that the defendants in Russia had  hacked into the claimant’s computer system in London in order to obtain confidential   and privileged information.  The claimant sought permission to serve a claim form on  the defendants in Russia pursuant to (what was then)  CPR 6.20 (8). In order to rely on  this jurisdictional gateway, the claimant had to show either that damage was sustained  within the jurisdiction or that the damage sustained  resulted from an act committed  within the jurisdiction. Sitting as a Deputy High Court J udge,  Mr Jonathan H irst QC  held that they succeeded on both grounds:   ‘62. Ashton’s  computer server was in London. That is where the  confidential and privileged information was stored. The attack  emanated from Russia  but it was directed at the server in London  and that is where the hacking occurred. In my view, significant  damage occurred in England where the server was improperly  accessed and the confidential and privileged information  downloaded.  The fact that it was transmitted almost instantly to  Russia does not mean that the damage occurred only in Russia.  If a thief ste als a confidential letter in London  but does not read  it until he is abroad, damage surely occurs in London. It should  not make a difference that, in a digital age of almost  instantaneous communication, the documents are stored in  digital form rather than hard copy and information is transm itted  electronically abroad where it is re ad. The removal took place in  London. …   63. I also consider  that substantial and efficacious acts occurred  in London, as well as Russia. That is where the hacking occurred  and access to the server was achieved. This may have been as a  result of actions taken in Russia but they were designed to make  things happen i n London, and they did so.  Effectively the safe  was open from afar so that its contents could be removed. It  would be artificial to say that the acts occurred only in Russia. Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      On the contrary, substantial and effective  acts occurred in  London.’   39. As can be seen from these citations, in both cases it was considered artificial  to say that  the act of hacking occurred only in the foreign state. I respectfully agree.   40. In my judgment this conclusion is in accordance, not only with the language of section  5 of the 1978 Act,  but also with the principles underpinning state immunity in  international law. That is because  the hacking by a foreign state of a computer  located  in this jurisdiction is an interference with the territorial sovereignty of the United  Kingdom, as already noted.  For this purpose it makes no difference where the agents  of the foreign state are located .  41. Wieder v United Kingdom , on which Professor Sarooshi relied , does not detract from  this conclusion. If anything, it supports it.  The case concerned  the bulk interception  of  communications by the United Kingdom intelligence  agencies . The applicant’s  communications, sent from outside the United Kingdom,  had been intercepted when  they passed through the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom argued that this was  outside the territorial scope  of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 1 of  which provides  that a state’s obligation to secure  the rights and freedoms defined in the  Convention is territorial. The argument was that the interception of communications   did not fall within a state’s  jurisdiction al competence  when the sender or recipient was  outside the territory of the state in question. Perhaps not surprisingly, the European  Court of Human Rights rejected this argument.  I agree with Mr Silverstone that this  decision provides no support to the defendant’s case .  42. However,  it is of some interest  that the Court  was prepared to look broadly at the  substance of the interference in determining where the act of interference occurred:   ‘93. … Although there are important differences between  electronic communications, for the purposes of Article 8 of the  Convention, and possessions, for the purposes of Article of  Protocol No. 1 , it is nevertheless the case that an interference  with an individual’s possessions occurs where the possession is  interfered with, rather than where the owner is located (see, for  example, Anheuser -Busch Inc v Portugal  [GC], no. 73049/01,  ECHR 2007 -I). Similarly, in the specific context of Article 8, it  could not se riously be suggested that the search of a person’s  home within a Contracting State would fall outside that State’s  territorial jurisdiction if the person was abroad when the  search  took place.  …’  43. In modern terms, the hacking of a person’s computer is equivalent to burglars breaking  in and stealing the contents of the ir safe. Just as the latter  is an act within the United  Kingdom, so too is the former.   44. Although  Professor Sarooshi  also relied  on the Computer Misuse Act 1990, in my  judgment that Act is of no assistance  in interpreting section 5 of t he State Immunity Act  1978.  The contexts and purposes of the two Acts  are completely different and in any  event the Computer Misuse Act was passed some  12 years after the 1978 Act. The way  in which Parliament  chose to legislate for computer misuse in 1990  can shed no light Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      on whether the hacking from abroad of a computer located in the United Kingdom is  an act  within the United Kingdom for the purposes of section 5 of the 1978  Act.  45. I agree with Mr Silverstone that the claimants derive some limited support from the  contrast between Article 11 of the E CSI and section 5 of the 1978 Act.  Article 11  provides:   ‘A Contracting State cannot claim immunity from the  jurisdiction  of a court of another Contracting State in  proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or  damage to tangible property,  if the facts which occasion the  injury or damage occurred in the territory of the State of the  forum, and if the author of the injury or damage was present in  that territory at the time when those facts occurred.’   46. Although I shall have to consider Article 11 more fully in connection with ground 2  below, it is immediately apparent that there are several differences  between the terms  of Article 11 and those of section 5  of the 1978 Act . In particular, the requirement  in  Article 11  for ‘the author of the injury or damage ’ to be present in the territory of the  forum state at the time when ‘the  facts which occasion the injury or damage occurred’  is not included  in section 5, and plainly this omission was deliberate.   47. For all these reasons, therefore, I would reject ground 1.   Ground 2 – Must all the acts by agents of the foreign state take place in the United  Kingdom?   48. The second ground of appeal is that the exception to immunity in section 5 of the 1978  Act requires that each and every act or omission causing injury that forms the basis for  liability must occur in the United Kingdom. Thus the exception does not apply  where  the act s in question are committed partly in the United Kingdom and partly abroad.   The judgment   49. The judge held that the pla in grammatical meaning of section 5 was that immunity  would not apply  if an act or omission causing personal injury took place in the United  Kingdom, even if other causative acts took place abroad:   ‘97. In my judgment, the grammatical meaning of s 5, and in  particular the use of the indefinite article (death or personal  injury caused by ' an act or omission') (emphasis added) means  what it says. There has to be an act or omission in the UK which  is causative of the requisite damage on a more than de minimis   basis. Parliament did not say ‘ the act or omission’, still less, ‘acts  or omissions occurring entirely within the UK’, both of which  would have been more supportive of the Defendant's  interpretation  of s 5. This suggests the Claimants’ contention is  the correct one .’  50. In reaching this conclusion, he followed his earlier judgment in Al-Masarir .  Submissions  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      51. Profess or Sarooshi criticised the judge’s approach, submitting that he had placed too  much reliance on the grammatical meaning of section 5. Prof essor Sarooshi  identified  five points which, he submitted, demonstrated that  the exception to immunity applied  only if  all of the acts causing personal injury  occur red in the United Kingdom . These  were: (1)  the fact that it was the purpose of section 5 to implement in domestic law the  provisions of Article 11  of the ECSI; (2) the decision of the Court of Appeal in Al- Adsani ; (3) principles of international comity, including the act of state doctrine; (4) the  personal injury  exception to state immunity contained in the UN Convention drafted by  the International Law Commission; and ( 5) the decisions of United States courts dealing  with the United States Foreign Sovereign  Immunities Act 1976 , which was to be  regarded as the precursor to our 1978  Act.  52. To be clear, Professor Sarooshi’s submission was that all of the acts causing the  personal injury  had to take place in United Kingdom, not that the injury itself must  occur here.  He disclaimed reliance on any case as to where  ‘in substance’ a tort is  committed (cf. in the jurisdictional context, Metall  & Rostoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin  & Jenrette Inc  [1990] 1 QB 391 ; and in the context of state immunity, contrast Heiser  v Islamic Republic of Iran  [2019] EWHC 2074 (QB)  at 148, where Mr Justice Stewart  pointed out that section 5  ‘is not concerned with where the substance of the tort is  committed’ ) and did not espouse  the ‘entire tort’ theory such as seen in the United States  cases considered  below.   53. Mr Silverstone submitted  that the judge  was right to regard the meaning of section 5 as  clear (‘as plain as plain can be’,  in Lord Justice Ward’s words in Al-Adsani ) and that  the points relied on by Professor Sarooshi  could not overcome this. But in any event,  he submitted that those points  did not lead to the conclusion for which Professor  Sarooshi contended.   Analysis   54. I agree with the judge that the language of section 5  is clear and unambiguous in this  respect. A foreign state does not have immunity  for personal injury caused by an act in  the United Kingdom, even if other causative acts  take place abroad.  Since the language  of the section is clear and unambiguous, there is no scope to arrive at a different  interpretation  based on the external aids on which Prof essor Sarooshi relied, although I  also agree with Mr Silverstone  that those aids do not support Bahrain’s  interpretation.   55. I consider that the  claimants’ interpretation of section 5 is in accordance with the  fundamental principles of international  law on which state immunity is based. Once  again,  a foreign state which hacks a computer located in the United Kingdom interfer es  with the territorial sovereignty of the United Kingdom  even if some of the acts in  question take place abroad.  Legislation  which is broadly similar to  the State Immunity  Act 1978 has been enacted in numerous jurisdictions  and there are international  conventions to similar effect, even if  such legislation does not (or does not yet)  represent customary international law.  Accordingly , if State A interferes with the  territorial sovereignty of State B by doing an act in State B which is liable to cause  death or personal injury to persons in State B, it takes the risk that it will be subject to  civil proceedings in State B. Such proceedings  are in accordance w ith principles of  international comity.   56. I consider in turn the matters on which Professor Sarooshi relied.  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      Article 11 of the ECSI   57. Professor  Sarooshi  submitted that one of the important reasons for enactment of the  1978 Act was to permit the United Kingdom  to become a party to the ECSI , and  specifically  that the purpose of section 5 of the Act was to implement Article 11 of the  ECSI in domestic law . For this purpose he relied on  the statement by the European  Court of Human Rights in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom  (2002) 34 EHRR 11 at [22]  that section 5 ‘was enacted to implement the 1972  European Convention on State  Immunity ’. He relied also on w hat are des cribed as ‘Notes on Clauses’  provided to  Ministers during the  Report Stage of the passage of the State Immunity Bill  in the House  of Lords . These Notes stated that a Bill was required to amend the law  of state immunity  to enable the United Kingdom to ratify  ECSI, which it had signed but not yet ratified .  They stated in relation to what became section 5 that:   ‘This Clause implements Article 11 of the Convention . As  paragraph 47 of the Explana tory Report  points out the necessary  jurisdictional links in this context  were based on Article 10(4) of  the Convention of the 1st February 1971  on the Recognition and  Enforcement of Foreign judgments in Civil and Commercial  Matters. The Report on that Convention indicates the intention  that a court should have jurisdiction for the purpose of the  Convention  in respect of a death or personal injury or damage to  tangible property which occurs outside the territory of the court,  provided that it was caused by an act or omission in the territory  of the forum and the person who was responsible for the act or  omis sion was present in the territory  when th e act or omission  occurred. Thus if a motor vehicle was negligently repaired in  United Kingdom by the servant of a foreign State and as a result  of that negligence and accident occurred in the territory of  another State which cause d death, personal injury,  loss of or  damage to tangible property it would be possible to take  proceedings against the State in the appropriate court of the  United Kingdom and the State would not be immune from the  jurisdiction. Article 11 of the Convention  requires the author of  the injury or damage to be present in the territory at the time  when the facts which occasion the injury or damage occurred.  These words have not been repeated in the Bill because it is  difficult to imagine circumstances when Clause 5 would apply   when the person responsible for the act or omission was outside  the United Kingdom.’   58. I would observe that although this Note states that the purpose of  section 5 was to  implement Article 11 of the ECSI, it also makes clear that the decision  to depart from  the terms of Article 11, and in particular to omit the requirement for the author of the  injury or damage to be present  in the forum state, was deliberate.  Although the Note   said that it was difficult to imagine circumstances when the person responsible for the  act or omission w ould be  outside the United Kingdom, it did not say that in suc h  circumstances (if the y occurred)  a foreign state would have immunity.  In any event,   many things which it would have been difficult to imagine in 1978 are now common  aspects of our daily life.  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      59. More fundamentally, however , these Notes on Clauses are not an admissible aid to  interpretation of the Act at all. They were provided to Ministers,  essentially as a briefing  note, but in 1978  were not even made available to Members of Parliament  (although it  appears that this practice had changed by the early 1990s) . As explained by Mr Justice  Sales in  R (Public & Commercial Services Union) v Minister for the Civil Service   [2010] EWHC 1027 (Admin), [2010] ICR 1198:   ‘55. In my judgment, notes on clauses (as distinct from published  explanatory notes) are not a proper aid to the interpretation of an  Act of Parliament, whether they are circulated to MPs (as  happened in relation to the 1990 Act) or not (as in relation to the  1972  Act). Although in the former case, unlike the latter case, it  might be argued that there are some grounds for saying that the  notes on clauses form part of the contextual background against  which the Bill was passed by Parliament as a collective body, so  that they should be taken to have an interpretive role and status  analogous to that of statements in a White Paper proposing  legislation, or in clear statements by a promoter of a Bill in  Parliament or in modern form Explanatory Notes, I think that  there i s an important difference from all these cases.  Notes on  clauses when not cited in debate are private documents not  available to the public at large, unlike White Papers, statements  reported in Hansard and published Explanatory Notes. An Act of  Parliament  creates law applicable to all citizens. In my judgment,  it is fundamental that all materials which are relevant to the  proper interpretation of such an instrument should be available  to any person who wishes to inform himself about the meaning  of that law . That is not the position in relation to notes on clauses  and for that reason I do not consider they are a legitimate aid to  construction of an Act of Parliament. …’  60. The Supreme Court dealt with  a similar argument concerning Notes on Clauses  in In re  Scottish Independence Referendum Bill  [2022] UKSC 31, [2022] 1 WLR 5435 a t [26],   although in this case  (unlike in 1977 -78) the Notes  were published  both online and in  hard copy , saying that:   ‘26. We do not, however, attach particular weight to the Notes  on Clauses. The document was drafted by government officials  and has no endorsement  by the United Kingdom Parliament . It  is much less significant than the language carefully chosen by  the parliamentary drafter  and enacted by Parliament. ’  61. I would add  that Bahrain  sought in the court below to rely on statements made in  Parliament during the passage of the Bill. The judge held that these statements  did not  satisfy the requirements set out in Pepper v Hart  [1993] AC 593, and that they were  therefore inadmissible. That decision has not been challenged on appeal.  Notes on  Clauses  which were private to Ministers are an a fortiori  case.   62. In fact  it is too simple, and therefore inaccurate, to say that the purpose (or even a  purpose) of the 1978 Act  was to implement the ECSI as a matter of domestic law.  The  true position  is that the Act gave broad effect to the ECSI,  but departed from it in a Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      number of respects. This is made clear by a number of statements of high authority. For  example, in  La G énérale des Carri ères & des Mines v FG Hemisphere Associates LLC  [2012]  UKPC 27, [ 2013] 1 All ER 409, Lord Mance said that:   ‘10. The Act  was aimed at giving broad effect  to (though not  following precisely the wording of) the European Convention on  State Immunity (Basle, 16  May 1972; Misc 31 (1972); Cmnd  5081),  which was agreed under the aegis of the Council of  Europe at Basle on 16 May 1972 and which entered into force  on 11 June 1976.’   63. To similar effect,  in General Dynamics  Lord Lloyd -Jones  pointed out  at [48] and  [76(4)]  that the 1978 Act ‘deliberately diverges from the ECSI’  in relation to the  enforcement of arbitration awards against a state. He concluded, therefore, that its  provisions cast little light  on the correct reading of section 12 of the 1978 Act, which is  concerned with service of court process on states.  Other examples  where the Act  diverges to a greater or lesser extent from the Convention include contractual  obligations (cf. section 3(1)(b)  of the Act and Article 4(1) of the ECSI ), employment  contracts (cf.  section 4(1) and Article 5(1)),  and companies (cf. section 8(1) and Article  6(1)) . It should therefore come as no surprise to find that section 5 is another provision  which diverges from the equivalent provision in the ECSI.   64. As already  explained, it is apparent from a comparison of section 5  of the 1978 Act  with Article 11 of the ECSI that Parliament deliberately departed from the terms of  Article 11.  Section 5 is not concerned with ‘the facts’ which occasion the injury or  damage, but with  ‘an act’ of the foreign state, while the requirement  for ‘the author of  the injury or damage’ to be present in the forum state has been deliberately omitted. In  these circumstances the terms of Article 11 are of no real help in interpreting section 5.   The European Court of Human Rights was therefore mistaken , save in a very broad and  general sense,  to say in Al-Adsani  that section 5 ‘was enacted to implement [Article 11  of] the 1972 European Convention on State Immunity’ , a statement which was in any  event unnecessary for its decision.   Al-Adsani  in the Court of Appeal   65. The claimant in Al-Adsani  alleged that he had been detained and tortured  in Kuwait  by  officials of the government of Kuwait , and that after leaving Kuwait and coming to live   in the United Kingdom, he received death threats from agents of the government of  Kuwait, including threats emanating from the Embassy of Kuwait in London.  He  claimed as a result to have suffered both physical and psychological injuries, and sought  to bring proceedings in the English courts against the government of Kuwait ,  contending t hat a state’s immunity did not extend to acts of torture.  This court held, so  far as the  alleged torture in Kuwait was concerned, that the exception to immunity in  section 5 did not apply , so that Kuwait was immune  pursuant to section 1 . This was the  context for Lord Justice Ward’s comment that ‘the Act is as plain as plain can be ’ to  which I have already referred.  Lord Justice Stuart -Smith said that it was clear that  ‘the  Act is a comprehensive code and is not subject to overriding considerations’.  On this  issue the decision was affirmed in Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia . Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      66. However, the claim in relation to the threats allegedly made  in the United Kingdom  failed for a different reason, on the facts. The judge was not satisfied that the threats  emanated from a person or persons acting  at the behest of the government of Kuwait or  for whom the government was responsible, and the claimant therefore failed to  discharge the burden  to satisfy the court of  these threats  on the balance of probabilit ies.  67. Professor Sarooshi  relied on this case as demonstrating that a state is immune as regards  acts outside the  United Kingdom.  I agree,  although that is already clear from the  language and scheme of the 1978 Act. However,  the case does not address the issue  with which we are concerned, which is whether  immunity applies when  there is  an act  causing personal injury in the United Kingdom  as well  as other causative acts which  occur outside the United Kingdom . If anything, because Al-Adsani  implies that the  threats allegedly made in the United Kingdom would have been justiciable  if they had  been sufficiently proved, it suggests that the state will not be immune as regards an act  within the United Kingdom  even where that act is related to and follows on from further  acts of the state occurring  outside the United Kingdom.  But as the point  does not appear  to have been argued, that may be reading too much into the decision.   International comity and act of state   68. Professor Sarooshi submitted  that to deprive Bahrain of immunity would infringe  principles of international comity because,  contrary to the act of state doctrine, it would  involve the English court sitting in judgment on acts performed within the territory  of  a foreign state. That would arise because the court would be adjudicating on the acts of  the agents of the government of Bahrain who, located in Bahrain, cause d the spyw are  to be installed  on the claimants’ computers.  He relied on  the principle most re cently  stated by Lord Lloyd -Jones in ‘Maduro Board’ of the Central Bank of  Venezuela  v  ‘Guaid ó’ Board of the Central Bank of Venezuela  (reported as  Deutsche Bank AG v  Receivers Appointed by the Court ) [2021] UKSC 57, [2023] AC 156:   ‘135. It appears therefore that a substantial body of authority, not  all of which is obiter , lends powerful support for the existence  of a rule that courts in this jurisdiction will not adjudicate or sit  in judgment on the lawfulness or validity under its own law of  an executive act of a foreign state, performed within the territory  of that state . The rule also has a sound basis in principle. It is  founded on the respect due to the sovereignty and independence  of foreign states and is intended to promote comity in inter -state  relations. While the same rationale underpins state immunity, the  rule is distinct from state immunity and is not required by  international law. It is not founded on the personal immunity of  a party directly or indirectly impleaded but upon the subject  matter of the proceedings. The rule does not turn on a  conventional applic ation of choice of law rules in private  international law nor does it depend on the lawfulness of the  conduct under the law of the state in question. On the contrary it  is an exclusionary rule, limiting the power of courts to decide  certain issues as to th e legality or validity of the conduct of  foreign states within their proper jurisdiction . It operates not by  reference to law but by reference to the sovereign character of  the conduct which forms the subject matter of the proceedings. Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      In the words of Lord Cottenham  [in Duke of Brunswick  v King  of Hanover  (1848) 2 HL Cas 1] , it applies “whether it be  according to law or not according to law”. I can, therefore, see  no good reason to distinguish in this regard between legislative  acts, in respect of which such a rule is clearly established (see  paras 171 -179 below), and execut ive acts. The fact that  executive acts may lack any legal basis does not prevent the  application of the rule. In my view, we should now acknowledge  the existence of su ch a rule. ’ (My emphasis)   69. It is, perhaps, sufficient to say that, as Lord Lloyd -Jones explained, the act of state  doctrine is distinct  from state immunity.  It cannot, therefore, cast much light on the true  meaning of section 5 of the 1978 Act.  Moreover, it is not at all clear i n my judgment   that allowing  these proceedings to continue on the merits would infringe the act of state  principle. As appears from the words which I have emphasised, t hat principle  applies  to the act of a foreign state ‘performed within the territory of that s tate … within [its]  proper jurisdiction ’. However,  the English proceedings will be concerned with the act  of infecting the claimants’ computers within the United Kingdom. The fact that the  agents who caused this to happen  were located in Bahrain at the time , if that proves to  be the case, is immaterial.  It is equally immaterial whether  whatever was done in  Bahrain was lawful under the law of Bahrain.  The act of state principle does not protect  a state which chooses, by an act committed within the United Kingdom,  to infringe the  territorial sovereignty of this country.   70. In this connection  I find persuasive the analysis of Justice LeBel in the Canadian  Supreme Court case of Kazemi v Iranian Republic of Iran  [2014] 3 SCR  176,  commenting on section 6 of the Canadian State Immunity Act 19 85 which is broadly  equivalent to our section 5:   ‘72. By contrast an interpretation of s. 6(a) that requires the tort  causing the personal injury or death to have occurred in Canada  upholds the purposes of sovereign equality without leading to  absurd results. It accords with the theory of sovereign equality to  allow foreign states to be sued in Canada for torts allegedly  committed by them within Canadian boundaries. As explored  above,  sovereignty is intimately tied to independence. State  independence  relates to the “exclusive competence of the State  in re gard to its own territory” ( Island of Palmas Case (or  Miangas ), United States of America v Netherlands , Award  (1928), II R.I.A.A. 829 at p. 838 ; Fox & Webb , at p. 74).  If a  foreign state is committing torts within Canadian control led  boundaries, Canada has the competence (derived from its  independence) to bring the foreign state within Canada’s  adjudicative jurisdiction. There would thus be a sufficient  connection with the forum state to justify bringing the foreign  state’s actions un der Canadian scrutiny.  In this way, the  territorial tort exception to state immunity maintains an  appropriate balance between “the principles of territorial  jurisdiction and state independence” ( Laroque, Civil Actions for  Uncivilised Acts , at p. 258. It enables a forum state to exercise Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      jurisdiction over foreign states within its borders without  allowing the forum state to “sit in judgment of extraterritorial  state conduct”  (ibid.). …’   The UN Convention   71. Article  12 of the UN Convention , headed ‘Personal injuries and damage to property ’,  provides as follows:   ‘Unless otherwise agreed between the States concerned, a State  cannot invoke immunity from jurisdiction before a court of  another State which is otherwise competent in a proceeding  which relates to pecuniary compensation for death or injury to  the person, or damage to or loss of tangible property,  caused by  an act or omission which is alleged to be attributable to the State,  if the act or omission occurred in whole or in part in the territory  of that other State and if the author of the act or omission was  present in that territory  at the time of the act or omission.’   72. The Convention  is not in force.  It has been signed, but not yet ratified, by the United  Kingdom .  73. Although  Article 12 has some similarities to Article 11 of the ECSI, there are also  differences. For example , like the ECSI, Article 12 of the UN Convention  provides that  immunity for personal injury is only lost  if the author of the act or omission was present  in the territory of the forum state at the time of the act or omission. On the other hand,  unlike the  ECSI, Article 12  provides that immunity is lost if the act or omission  occurred ‘in whole or in part’ in the territory of the forum state.   74. Professor  Sarooshi submitted that, in practice, immunity would only be lost under  Article 12 if all the acts  causing personal injury occurred in the forum state.  While that  may be so,  and while it has been said  (as a general comment)  that the Convention  ‘powerfully demonstrates international thinking’  on state immunity ( Jones v Ministry  of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  per Lord Bingham at [8]), I cannot see  how a convention concluded in 2004, which is not in force  and which d oes not purport  to represent existing customary international law, can have any bearing on the  interpretation of the 1978 Act.  It is not even  a consistently safe guide to the content of  customary international law, for the reasons explained by Lord Lloyd -Jones in General  Dynamics  at [52] to [54] and, as Lord Lloyd -Jones also explained at [50], it is necessary  to approach general statements about the Convention with caution .  The United States ‘entire tort’ cases   75. In the United States the applicable legislation is the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act  1976 . This was described by Lord Clarke in SerVaas  Inc v Rafidain Bank  [2012] UKSC  40, [2013] 1 AC 595 at [23] as ‘a leading precursor ’ of the 1978 Act , where the issue  concerned the meaning of the expression ‘in use … for commercial purposes’ in section  13(4)  of the 1978 Act. At [28] Lord Clarke treated United States cases on the equivalent  section  of the 1976 Act as ‘ strong persuasive authority’ . Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      76. The United States equivalent to section 5 of the 1978 Act  is known as ‘the non - commercial tort exception’. It provides that there is no immunity  from an action  involving ‘personal injury or death, or damage to or loss of property, occurring in the  United States and caused by the tortious act or omission of [a] foreign state  or of any  official or employee of that foreign state while acting within  the scope of his office or  employment’.  However, the United States courts have developed what is known as ‘the  entire tort’ doctrine,  pursuant to which immunity w ill only be lost if  ‘the entire tort –  including not only the injury but also the act precipitating that injury ’ occurs in the  United States: e.g. Jerez v Republic of Cuba  775 F.3d 419  (2014), quoting Asociacion  de Reclamantes v United Mexican States  735 F.2d 1517 (1984) . (It should be noted,  however, that th e ‘entire tort’ doctrine does not apply to the ‘terrorist exception ’  contained in section 1605A of the 1976 Act which was introduced by amendment in  1996).  Professor Sarooshi does not sugges t that this entire tort doctrine  forms any part  of United Kingdom law under the State Immunity Act 1978.   77. It was by reference to this United States doctrine that the United States Court of Appeals  for the District of Columbia  Circuit dismissed a claim on similar facts to the present  case.  In Doe, aka Kidane v Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia  851 F.3d 7 (2017)   the claimant alleged that h e was tricked in the United States into downloading a  computer  program which enabled Ethiopia to spy on him from abroad.  The state tort on  which he relied was ‘intrusion upon seclusion’ which , under Maryland law, required  the formation of an intent by the defendant as well as the  interference with the  claimant’s computer. The court said that the tortious intent  aimed at the claimant was  formed outside the United States, as was the tortious act of computer programming,   albeit that Ethiopia’s placement of the FinSpy vi rus on the claimant’s computer  was  completed in the United States. It held, therefore, that the entire tort did not occur in  the United States  and Ethiopia was entitled to immunity.  (I note in passing  that the court  appears to have regarded the placement of the FinSpy virus on the claimant’s computer  as an act occurring in the United States,  which may have some relevance to ground 1  in the present case).   78. Although Professor Sarooshi relied on this decision, in my judgment it does not assist  him. As he accepted, the legal principle on which it is based does not form part of  United Kingdom law.  Moreover, as with the UN Convention, it is necessary to be  cautious about general statements  regarding United States authorities , applying  different legislation  by reference to (in the case of the non -commercial tort exception)  different legal concepts.   79. There is a particular  need for caution in a context such as the present where the United  States courts pla ce some emphasis on the legislative history of the provisions in  question. For example,  in the  Asociacion de Reclamantes  case the court recognised that  ‘the statutory provision is susceptible of the interpretation that only the effect of the  tortious action need occur here’, but nevertheless  applied a different interpretation  because , quoting the House Report :  ‘The legislative history makes clear that for the exception of  1605(a)(5) to apply  “the tortious act or omission must occur  within the jurisdiction of the United States” .’  80. No doubt , in some cases , of which SerVaas  was one, decisions of United States courts  on equivalent provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act 1976 will constitute Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      strong persuasive authority as to the meaning  of provisions of the 1978 Act.  But that  will generally depend on the closeness of the language of the two provisions  and on the  absence of particular domestic principles of United States law.   81. For these reasons , I would also reject ground 2 of this appeal.   Ground 3 – Is psychiatric injury ‘personal injury’ within the meaning of section  5?  82. The claimants’ case,  supported by expert evidence, is that the  discovery of the hac king  of their computers caused them psychiatric injury.  The first claimant  is alleged to have  developed  an adjustment disorder, while the second claimant is alleged to have  undergone a significant exacerbation of the adjustment disorder from which he already  suffered.  An adjustment disorder is a recognised  condition , described by the judge as   involv ing otherwise normal emotional and behavioural reactions that manifest more  intensely than usual (considering contextual and cultural factors) , causing marked  distress, preoccupation with the stress or its consequences, and functional impairment.   83. The third and final ground of appeal  is that standalone claims of psychiatric injury do  not constitute ‘personal injury’  within the meaning of section 5  of the 1978 Act.   The judgment   84. The judge  held that psychiatric injury does constitute ‘personal injury’ within the  meaning of section 5 of the 1978 Act . He relied on two decisions of the Employment  Appeal Tribunal to that effect, Military Affairs Office of the Embassy of the State of  Kuwait v Caramba -Coker  [2003] UKEAT /1054/02 and Federal Republic of Nigeria v  Ogbonna  [2011] UKEAT /585/10, [2012] 1 WLR 1 39, citing extensively  from the  decision of Mr Justice Underhill in the latter case  and pointing out that it had been  referred to  with approval  by this court in Zu Sayn -Wittgenstein -Sayn v His Majesty Juan  Carlos  de Borb ón y Borb ón [2022] EWCA Civ 1595, [2023] 1 WLR 1162.   85. For the purpose of the state immunity   issue the judge  was satisfied,  on the basis of  expert evidence, that the claimants had sufficiently proved their case on the facts. That  point  has not been challenged on appeal  (but see [14] above) .  Submissions   86. Professor Sarooshi  accepted that there would be no immunity for an act in the United  Kingdom causing psychiatric injury if this was associated with physical injury , but   submitted that ‘standalone’ psychiatric injury  was not within the meaning of  ‘personal  injury’ in section 5 of the 1978 Act.  He recognised that English courts now regard the  term ‘personal injury’ as including  both physical and psychiatric injury, but submitted  that this approach should not be applied to the 1978 Act  on the ground that  it was not  clearly estab lished in 1978 even as a matter of English law , let alone in international  law. He relied again on Article 11 of the ECSI, pointing out that the equally authentic  French text  refers to ‘ un pr éjudice corporel ’; on Article 12 of the UN Convention,   which in its French text refers to ‘ l’intégrit é physique d’une personne ’; and on Canadian  case law, which holds that ‘Only when psychological distress manifests itself  after a  physical injury will the exception to state immunity be triggered’ ( Schreiber v Federal  Republic of Germany  [2002] 3 RCS 269 and Kazemi v Islamic Republic of Iran  at [75]) .  Accordingly Ogbonna  was wrongly decided.  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      87. Professor Sarooshi relied also  on the Notes on Clauses  supplied to Ministers during the  passage of the 1978 Bill through Parliament, which stated that :  ‘Where there has been injury to the person or damage to  property , the rule of non -immunity applies equally to any  accompanying claim for non -material  damage resulting from the  same acts, e.g. a claim for damages for pain and suffering or for  mental shock.’    88. However,  as I have already held that the Notes on Clauses are not admissible, I need  say no more about them.   89. This ground of appeal was addressed by Professor Philippa Webb on behalf of the  claimants.  She submitted , in summary, that as a matter of statutory interpretation,   section 5 of the 1978 Act should not be tied to concepts of ‘personal injury’ as they  were understood in 1978 (the ‘always speaking’ principle);  that the decision of Mr  Justice Underhill in Ogbonna is correct;  that even in 1978, ‘personal injury’ was  understood as including standalone psychiatric injury in English law; that there was no   settled international law concept of ‘personal injury’ which excluded stand -alone  psychiatric injury’; and that the Canadian case law  is irrelevant.   Analysis   90. Broadly speaking, I accept  Professor Webb’s submissions.    ‘Always speaking ’  91. It is a general principle of statutory interpretation that a statute is not frozen in time at  the date of its enactment, but should be interpreted taking into account changes that  have occurred since its enactment.  The princip le was explained by the Supreme Court  in News Corp  UK & Ireland Ltd v Revenue & Customs Commissioners  [2023] UK 7,  [2024] AC 89:   ‘27. It is clear that the modern approach to statutory  interpretation in English (and UK) law requires the courts to  ascertain the meaning of the words used in a statute in the light  of their context and the purpose of the statutory provision: see,  eg, Quintavalle , para 8 (per Lord Bingham); Uber BV v Aslam   [2021] UKSC 5; [2021] ICR 657, para 70; Rittson -Thomas v  Oxfordshire County Council  [2021] UKSC 13; [2022] AC 129,  para 33; R(O) v Secretary of State for the Home Department   [2022] UKSC 3; [2022] 2 WLR 34 3, paras 28 -29. 28. Within that  modern approach, it is also a well -established principle of  statutory interpretation that, in general, a provision is always  speaking: see, eg, Royal College of Nursing of the United  Kingdom v Department of Health and Social Security (“Royal  College of Nursing”)  [1981] AC 800; R v Ireland  [1998] AC  147, 158 -159 ; Quintavalle ; Owens v Owens  [2018] UKSC 41,  [2018] AC 899 (approving [2017] EWCA Civ 182, [2017] 4  WLR 74); Test Claimants in the Franked Investment Income  Group Liti gation v Revenue and Customs Commissioners  [2020] Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      UKSC 47, [2022] AC 1. See also Craies on Legislation  (ed  Daniel Greenberg), 12th ed, (2022) ch 21; and Bennion, Bailey  and Norbury on Statutory Interpretation  8th ed, (2020) ch 14.   29. What is meant by the always speaking principle is that, as a  general rule, a statute should be interpreted taking into account  changes that have occurred since the statute was enacted. Those  changes may include, for example, technological developments,  changes in scientific understanding, changes in social attitudes  and changes in the law. Very importantly it does not matter that  those changes could not have been reasonably contemplated or  foreseen at the time that the provision was enacted.  Exceptional ly, the always speaking principle will not be applied  where it is clear, from the words used in the light of their context  and purpose, that the provision is tied to an historic or frozen  interpretation. A possible example (referred to by Lord Steyn in  R v Ireland  at p 158) is The Longford  (1889) 14 PD 34 where the  word “action” in a statute was held not to be apt to cover an  Admiralty action in rem: at the time the statute was passed, the  Admiralty Court “was not one of His Majesty’s Courts of Law”  (p 38).    30. The great merit of the always speaking principle is that it  operates to prevent statutes becoming outdated. It would be  unrealistic for Parliament to try to keep most statutes up to date  by continually passing amendments to cope with subsequent  change. ’  92. I see no reason to suppose that section 5 of the 1978 Act  was intended to be ‘tied to an  historic or frozen interpretation’. On the contrary,  it was recognised that the law of state  immunity was undergoing a process of development.  The position might be different  if  there ha d been a settled understanding in international law that personal injury did not  include standalone psychiatric injury, but (as discussed below) there was no such  understanding.   93. An interesting and relevant example of the ‘always speaking’ principle, discussed in  News Corp  at [33], is R v Ireland  [1997] UKHL 34, [1998]  AC 147 .  In that case the  House of Lords decided that ‘grievous bodily harm ’ and ‘actual bodily harm ’ in sections  18, 20 and 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861  included standalone  psychiatric injuries . After tracing  developments in the understanding of mental injury  and pointing out that ‘The civil law  has for a long time taken account of the fact that  there is no rigid distinction b etween body and mind’ , Lord Steyn said :  ‘ … the distinction between physical and mental injury is by no  means clear cut. … But I would go further and point out that  although out of considerations of piety we frequently refer to the  actual intention of the draftsman, the correct approach is simply  to consider whether the words of the Act of 1861 considered in  the light of contemporary knowledge cover a recognisable  psychiatric injury. It is undoubtedly true that there are statutes  where the correct approach is to construe the legislation "as if Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      one were interpreting it the day after it was  passed:"  The Longford  (1889) 14 PD 34 . Thus in  The  Longford  the word "action" in a statute was held not to be apt to  cover an Admiralty action in rem since when it was passed the  Admiralty Court "was not one of His Majesty's Courts of Law:"  (see pp. 37, 38.) Bearing in mind that statutes are usually  intended to op erate for many years it would be most  inconvenient if courts could never rely in difficult cases on the  current meaning of statutes. Recognising the pr oblem Lord  Thring, the great Victorian draftsman of the second half of the  last century, exhorted draftsmen to draft so that "An Act of  Parliament should be deemed to be always speaking":  Practical  Legislation  (1902), p.83; see also  Cross , Statutory  Interpretation , 3rd ed. (1995), p.51;  Pearce & Geddes , Statutory  Interpretation in Australia , 4th ed. (1996), pp.90 -93. In cases  where the problem arises it is a matter of interpretation whether  a court must search for the historical or original meaning of a  statute or whether it is free to apply the current meaning of the  statute to present day conditions. Statutes dealing with a  particular grievance or problem may sometimes require to be  historically interpreted. But the drafting technique of  Lord  Thring  and his successors have brought about the situation  that statutes will generally be found to  be of the "always  speaking" variety: see  Royal College of Nursing of the United  Kingdom v. Department of Health and Social Security  [1981]  AC 800  for an example of an "always speaking" construction in  the House of Lords.   The proposition that the Victorian legislator when enacting  sections 18, 20 and 47 of the Act 1861, would not have had in  mind psychiatric illness is no doubt correct. Psychiatry was in its  infancy in 1861. But the subjective intention of the draftsman is  immaterial. The only relevant enquiry is as to the sense of the  words in the context in which they are used. Moreover the Act  of 1861 is a statute of the "always speaking" type: the statute  must be interpreted in the light of the best current scientific  appreciation of the link between the body and psychiatric injury. ’  94. The real distinction,  as Lord Steyn explained it, was between a mental  condition which  amounted to a recognis ed psychiatric  injury and one ( such as alarm , fear  or distress)  which did not.  That is an important distinction in the context of the tort of h arassment ,  discussed above,  which is committed when a course of unacceptable and oppressive  conduct , targeted at another person, cause s that person alarm, fear or distress . That is  not the same as psychiatric injury.   95. As it is common ground that, whatever the position in 1978, English law now regards  psychiatric injury as falling within the term ‘personal injury’, section 5 should be  interpreted in this way  unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary .  Ogbonna  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      96. The first EAT case on which the judge relied  was Caramba -Coker . In that case Mr  Justice Keith  held that  a claim to have suffered severe depression  (as distinct from  injury to feelings) as a result of discrimination was a claim for personal injury within  the meaning of section 5 of the 1978 Act.  However, the reasoning was fairly brief. In  the second EAT case, Ogbonna , the point was fully considered.  The defendant state’s  argument (see at [14]) was that  ‘whatever might be its meaning in a purely domestic  context … the phrase “personal injury”  should be interpreted as it would be understood  as a matter of international law; and that as [a] matter of international law a claim for  compensation for harm to a claimant’s mental health  would be regarded as a claim for  personal injuries if, but only if, it was consequent on a physical injury in the sense of  some damage to the body as opposed to the mind’.   97. Mr Justice Underhill accepted at [15] that in general the 1978 Act  should be interpreted  so far as possible to conform to any recognised international norm.  He was not  persuaded, however,  that the international law materials on which the defendant state  relied  demonstrated any ‘recognised meaning in international law to the phrase  “personal injury” which is more limited than the natural meaning of those words in  domestic law’.  Those materials included Article 11 of the ECSI, Article 12 of the UN  Convention,  and the explanatory reports and commentaries on those  Conventions.   Rather, the distinction drawn was not between physical and mental injury, but between  injury to the person on the one hand and such other forms of injury as damage to  economic interests or to reputation on the other.   98. Mr Justice Underhill  considered that this distinction explained the decision of the  Canadian Supreme Court in Schreiber  v Germany . The personal injuries  claimed in that  case consisted of ‘mental distress, denial of liberty and damage to reputation’, but   mental distress fell short of any recognised psychiatric injury, and t he decision in  Schreiber  that a claim for personal injury  required a physical injury should be read in  that light.  But even if Schreiber  was to be read  as excluding standalone psychiatric  injury from the concept of personal injury, that did not justify the conclusion that the  phrase  ‘personal injury’ had a recognised meaning in international law which would  exclude psychiatric injury.   99. Mr Justice Underhill said that he was glad to reach that conclusion:   ‘28. … Not only is the distinction urged on me by Mr Pipi  [counsel for Nigeria] one which would mean that the concept of  personal injury  in section 5 of the Act was different from its  meaning elsewhere in English law but it would give rise to what  would frequently be difficult, and frankly artificial,  debates  about the extent to which a particular injury in respect of which  a claim was made was physical or mental. The whole trend of  recent authority has been to recognise that these kinds of  distinction are difficult both conceptually and evidentially.’   100. Subject to what I say below about Schreiber , I respectfully agree with this reasoning .  101. In Zu Sayn -Wittgenstein -Sayn  the claimant brought a claim against the former king of  Spain , alleging that he had embarked upon a course of conduct against her which  amounted to harassment . The first issue in the case w as whether the ex -king was  immune in respect of acts alleged to constitute part of that course of conduct  which had Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      occurred before his abdication  on the basis that the acts in question were within the  sphere of  governmental or sovereign activity . This court held that he was immune as  the acts were of a sovereign nature.   102. However,  an issue also arose whether the injury allegedly suffer ed by the claimant   amounted to personal injury within the meaning of section 5 of the 1978 Act.  She  claimed to have suffered ‘great mental pain, alarm, anxiety, distress, loss of well -being,  humiliation and moral stigma’  and to suffer from sleep deprivation and nightmares .  There was no allegation of physical injury.  The judge, Mr Justice Nicklin, held that this  was not a case of personal injury within section 5 because  there was no claim for an y  recognised psychiatric injury, citing Ogbonna . In a judgment with which  Lady Justice  King and Lord Justice Popplewell agreed, Lady  Justice Simler  approved his decision   and reasoning :  ‘71. The judge addressed the argument advanced on the  respondent’s behalf by reference to the personal injury exception  in section 5 SIA as follows:   “76. Although, based on my decision, the point does not arise,  I should deal, finally, with the submission that, had an  immunity subsisted, the claimant's claim could nevertheless  continue on the basis of s ection 5 of the SIA. I would have  rejected that argument. The claimant's claim is for pure  harassment. The loss she claims does not include a claim for  any recognised psychiatric injury (see [10] above). As such, I  do not accept that the claimant's claim is, or includes, a claim  for personal injury. A claim for distress and anxiety arising  from an alleged course of conduct amounting to harassment  is not, without more, a personal injury claim. Neither of the  authorities relied upon by Mr Lew is QC assists the claimant.  The claimant in Jones v Ruth  [2011] EWCA Civ 804, [2012]  1 WLR 1495 was pursuing a claim for psychiatric injury (i.e.  a claim for personal injury). Nigeria v Ogbonna  [2012] 1  WLR 139 is authority only for the proposition that "p ersonal  injury", as used in s ection 5 of the  SIA, should be given its  normal meaning in domestic law; i.e. to include a claim for a  recognised psychiatric injury (see [27] per Underhill J). The  short point is that, in her Particulars of Claim, the claimant  makes no claim that she has been caused a recognised  psychiatric injury by the alleged harassment. Her claim is  therefore not a claim for personal injury within the terms of  section 5 of the SIA; it is a claim for distress caused by the  alleged harassment .”   72. Mr Lewis [counsel for the claimant] accepted that the  original pleading did not specifically use the phrase “personal  injury” or adduce a medical expert report as to any asserted  psychiatric injury suffered by the respondent, as is required for a  personal injury claim by CPR PD 16, para 4. However, the  Particulars of Claim pleaded a claim at paragraph 7.1 for  damages caused by anxiety and damage to the respondent’s Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      health caused by harassment. Moreover, he relied on the clearly  pleaded claim at paragraphs 56.1 and 56.3, for damages for  anxiety, distress and depression. Although in writing he  submitted this sufficiently pleaded a recognised psychiatric  injury, he acce pted in the course of the hearing, that it did not,  and that personal injury was not in fact pleaded in the original  Particulars of Claim.   73. However, he maintained that these passages made clear that  the respondent intended to claim damages for injury to her  health, and it was open to her to provide further particulars  documenting the extent of her injuries (which she has now done  in the dr aft Re -Amended Particulars of Claim, including by  reference to an expert medical report). Certainly, by the time of  the hearing before the judge and having raised reliance on  section 5 of the SIA, it was clear that she regarded her claim as  a claim for per sonal injury, and the amended pleading  demonstrates that this is the case she intends to run. The  amendment would cure any defect and she should have been  given the opportunity to cure any defect in her pleading, if there  is one.   74. I do not accept these submissions and can see no error in the  judge’s conclusion in respect of section 5 of the SIA. The claim  was plainly not pleaded as a personal injury claim nor were  damages for personal injury claimed in the prayer. As the judge  correctly held, a claim for distress and anxiety arising from an  alleged course of conduct amounting to harassment is  not,  without more, a personal injury claim. The short point, again as  the judge observed, is that the respondent made no claim that she  has been caused a recognised psychiatric injury by the alleged  harassment. Her claim is therefore not a claim for personal injury  within the terms of section 5  of the  SIA. It is simply a claim for  distress, anxiety and depression (none of which, as pleaded, are  recognised psychiatric conditions) caused by the alleged  harassment. ’  103. No submission was made to us that  this case is binding upon us, but it seems to me that  it is binding authority that a claim for distress and anxiety which does not amount to a  recognised psychiatric injury is not a claim for personal injury within section 5, and is  at the very least strong persuasive authority , approving Ogbonna , that a standalone  claim  to have suffered a recognised psychiatric injury is  a claim for personal injury  within section 5 . If that is not so,  the passage which I hav e set out  makes little sense.    Personal injury in English law  as understood in 1978   104. Professor Webb was able to show  that even in 1978  ‘personal injury’ was regarded in  English law as encompassing  standalone  psychiatric injury. She pointed to numerous  statutes enacted between  1948 and 1980 which defined ‘personal injury’  as an  impairment of  a person’s  physical or mental condition : the Law Reform (Personal  Injuries) Act 1948, section 3;  the Employer’s Liability (Defective Equipment ) Act, Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      section 1; the Administration of Justice Act 19 70, section 33; the Defective Premises  Act 1972, section  6; the Trade Union & Labour Relations Act 1974, section  14; the  Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, section  14; the Consumer Safety Act 1978 , section 9;  and the Limitation Act 1980, section 38. Case law  also established that ‘nervous shock,  or, to put it in medical terms,  … any recognisable psychiatric illness caused by the  breach of duty by the defendant’ was a form of personal injury (Hinz v Berry  [1970] 2  QB 40, 42H, the famous ‘ bluebell time in Kent’  case; McLoughlin v O’Brian  [1983]  AC 410 ; and , albeit somewhat later,  Page v Smith  [1996] AC 155 ).  105. It is therefore highly probable that when Parliament use d the term ‘personal injury’ in  the 1978 Act, that term was understood  to include standalone psychiatric injury, at any  rate in the absence of a settled  contrary meaning in international law.   No settled international law meaning   106. Mr Justice Underhill’s analysis  of the international law materials in Ogbonna  was as  follows:     ‘16. I start with article  11 of the European Convention . That  reads simply as follows:   “A Contracting State cannot claim immunity from the  jurisdiction of a court of another Contracting State in  proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or  damage to tangible property, if the facts which occasion the  injury or damage occurr ed in the territory of the State of the  forum, and if the author of the injury or damage was present  in that territory at the time when those facts occurred.”    That provision by itself seems to me to cast no relevant light on  the question before me. The phrase “injury to the person”, or  “préjudice corporel ” in the French text (which is of equal  authority), seems to me perfectly apt to cover cases of injury to  mental health, though I accept that it does not necessarily do so.   17. I turn to the explanatory report on the European Convention   promulgated by the Council of Europe. Article 11 is the subject  of paragraphs 47 -49 of the commentary. I need only quote  paragraph  48, which reads as follows:   “Where there has been injury to the person or damage to  property, the rule of non -immunity applies equally to any  concomitant claims for non -material damage resulting from  the same acts, provided of course that a claim for such damage  lies under the applic able law (e.g. in respect of pretium  doloris ). Where there has been no physical injury and no  damage to tangible property the Article does not apply. This  is the case, for example, as regards unfair competition … or  defamation.”  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      Mr Pipi relies on the statement that “where there has been no  physical injury … the Article does not apply”, but I cannot place  any real weight on that statement in the context in which it  appears. I am ready to accept that the phrase “physical injury”,  read literally, refers more naturally to bodily than mental harm,  but it does not appe ar that the authors were concerned with the  distinction between injury to physical and mental health. Rather,  as is clear from the concluding sentence, they were concerned  with the distinction between injury to the person on the one hand  and such other for ms of injury as damage to economic interests  or to reputation on the other.   18. The next item to which Mr  Pipi refers consists of the Report  of the International Law Commission on the work of its 43rd  session, which laid the foundations for the United Nations  Convention . Article  12 of that Convention  is in substantially the  same terms as article  11 of the European Convention . In its  commentary on article  12 the Report says at paragraph  (5):  “Article 12 does not cover cases where there is no physical  damage. Damage to reputation or defamation is not personal  injury in the physical sense, nor is interference with contract  rights or any rights including economic or social rights  damage to tangib le property.”   I would make the same observations about that passage as I do  about the commentary on article  11 in the explanatory report on  the European Convention : see above.   19. Mr Pipi also relied on two passages from The Law of State  Immunity  by Lady Fox. He referred me to passages in the second  edition at pages 281 and 577. At page 281 Lady Fox says, by  reference to section 5 of the 1978 Act:   “The limitation to torts causing physical damage reflects the  general reluctance of states to adjudicate on statements made  by other states where and however published and whether  malicious or negligent.”   The passage at page 577, commenting on article 12 of the United  Nations Convention , says this:   “The tortious conduct covered by this exception is confined  to acts causing physical damage to the person or property;  damage resulting from words spoken or written remains  immune.”   But, again, Lady Fox was concerned there to draw a distinction  between physical damage on the one hand and damages, to other  interests, in particular to reputation, on the other. She was not  addressing the question of whether personal injury could include Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      damage to mental health, and the use of the phrase “physical  injury” cannot fairly be read to be expressing a view on that  question.   …  21. In sum, I find nothing in the international law materials  which supports Mr  Pipi’s submission that there is a recognised  meaning in international law to the phrase “personal injury”  which is more limited than the natural meaning of those words  in domestic law.’   107. I respectfully agree with this analysis.   The Canadian cases   108. In Schreiber v Germany  the claimant was arrested and spent  eight days in prison in  Canada pursuant to an extradition warrant  issued by a court in the Federal Republic of  Germany. He claimed damages  for mental distress, denial of liberty and damage to  reputation  allegedly suffered as a result.  The Canadian Supreme Court  held that this did  not constitute ‘personal injury’ within the meaning of section 6  of the Canadian  State  Immunity Act  1985 , as the term ‘personal injury ’ only extended to mental distress and  emotional upset insofar as they were linked to a physical injury.  Section 6 provided  in  its English text :  ‘A foreign state is not immune from the jurisdiction of a court in  any proceedings that relate to   (a) any death or personal injury, or   (b) any damage to or loss of property   that occurs in Canada.’   109. It is clear, however,  that the decision was based on interpretation of this legislation in  the light of domestic rather than international law principles , including the  Canadian  principles for interpreting bilingual statutes . As Justice LeBel explained:   ‘51. The questions at stake fall within the purview of the  domestic legislation. Indeed, it can be argued  that the domestic  legislation is more specific than the rules set out by the  international legal principles and as such, there would be little  utility in examining international legal principles in detail. In  other cases, international law principles  and the disposition of  the matter might turn on their interpretation and application. In  this appeal, the case turns on the interpretation of the bilingual   versions of s.6(a) of State Immunity Act, discussed below,  rather  than the interpretation of international law principles.’   110. Justice LeBel  accepted  that the English text might be understood as including more than  physical injury,  but considered that the French text (‘ dommages corporels ’) was Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      confined to injury related to bodily injury and that it was necessary to give a harmonious  interpretation  taking account of both language versions:   ‘56. A principle of bilingual statutory interpretation holds that  where one version is ambiguous and the other is clear and  unequivocal, the common meaning of the two versions would a  priori  be preferred.  … Furthermore,  where one of the two  versions is broader than the other, the common meaning would  favour the more restricted or limited meaning. ’  111. Thus:   ‘65. Based  on the provisions of the C.C.Q. [Civil Code of  Quebec] and the relevant case law and doctrine set out above, I  believe that the civil law concepts of  “préjudice corporel  –  bodily injury ”, despite their flexibility, incorporate an inner  limitation to the potential ambit of s. 6(a) of the Act,  requiring  some form of interference with physical integrity. Although the  terms “death” or “personal injury” found in the English version   allow the possibility of non -physical injury to be captured within  the s. 6(a) exception,  the civil law concept of “ dommages  corporels ” found in the French version of s. 6(a) does not. As the  French version is the clearer and more restrict ive version of the  two, it best reflects the common intention of the legislat or found  in both versions. …’   112. I would add that  the case is also consistent with English law  in that the damage allegedly  suffered did not consist of any recognised psychiatric injury, although this does not  appear to have formed any part of the reasoning of the court.   113. In Kazemi v Iran  the claimant’s  mother was imprisoned in Iran, where she was beaten,  sexually assaulted and tortured. She later died of a brain injury sustained  while in the  custody of Iranians officials. The claimant  instituted civil proceedings against Iran on  his own behalf and on behalf of his mother’s estate. The estate’s claim  was for damages  for physical, psychological and emotional pain and suffering.  Iran was held entitled to  immunity  on the basis that (as in  in Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia  in this jurisdiction) there is no ‘torture’ exception  to a state’s general  immunity and the statutory exception in section 6  applie s only where the t ort causing  the personal injury or death  occurred in Canada.  The claimant’s  claim for his own  psychological  damage and emotional prejudice failed on the additional basis that the  ‘personal or bodily injury’ exception in section 6 did not apply where the injury suffered  did not stem from a physical breach of personal integrity .  114. Despite a challenge,  the Canadian Supreme Court affirmed its earlier decision in  Schreiber , holding that:   ‘74. However, even if the alternative interpretation of s. 6(a)  were accepted,  Mr Ha shemi’s  circumstance would still not fall  within the exception to state immunity. The “personal bodily  injury” exception to state immunity does not apply where the Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      alleged injury does not stem from a physical breach of personal  integrity.   75. In Schreiber , our Court  confirmed that “the scope of the  exception” in s. 6(a) is limited to instances where mental distress  and emotional upset were linked to a physical injury” (para 42).  Only when psychological distress manifests itself after a  physical injury  will be exception to state immunity be triggered.  In other words, “some form of a breach of physical integrity must  be made out” (para 62).’   115. Although Kazemi  affirmed Schreiber , this does not  alter the fact that both decisions on  this issue  are founded on Canadian principles for interpreting bilingual statutes .  Although any decision of the Canadian Supreme Court is entitled to great respect, these  cases do not purport , at least  on this issue , to be based on principles of international  law. Nor do  they evidence any settled understanding in international law of the meaning  of ‘personal injury’ in the context of state immunity.   116. For these reasons I would reject ground 3 of this appeal.   The Respondents’ Notice   117. I should record that the  claimants  submitted that  an interpretation of section 5 of the  1978 Act which confer s immunity on Bahrain  would breach the ir right of access to a  court under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights  and that the section  would therefore need, in accordance with section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998, to  be read down  so as to preclude a grant of immunity to Bahrain in this case.  Professor  Webb (who also dealt with this issue) relied  on the principle s stated in Benkharbouch e  v Embassy of the Republic of Sudan  that (1) state immunity  does in principle deprive  the claimant of access to a court under Article 6, but (2) this can be  justified , but only   where such immunity is in accordance with a rule of customary international law which  denies the court jurisdiction.   118. As I have concluded that the appeal fails, it is unnecessary to consider this issue  and I  do not propose to do so .  Disposal   119. I would dismiss the appeal.   LORD JUSTICE WARBY:   120. A claim for damages for harassment by spying is unusual. At first sight it seems  paradoxical. A course of conduct cannot amount to harassment of another unless it  comes to their attention and has an impact upon them.  Commonly, that is what the  perpetrator intends. Spies , on the other hand,  typically act surreptitiously, hoping and  intend ing that their activities will go undetected  by the target . But such a claim is not  unprecedented: see Gerrard v Eurasian Natural Resources Corp Ltd  [2020] EWHC  3241 (QB), [ 2021] EMLR 8 and Al-Masarir v Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  [2022] EWHC  2199 ( QB), [2023] QB 475  [12]-[20].  And this appeal is not about the viability of the  claim but about the court’s jurisdiction  over it .  Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.  Shehabi v Kingdom of Bahrain      121. I agree that the appeal on ground one fails f or the reasons given by Lord Justice Males.  In my view, t he artificiality of the appellant’s argument is highlighted by the answer  Professor Sarooshi gave to a question posed in argument. He submitted that when a  person uses a pen to create a manuscript document the marks on the page are not part  of the act of w riting but only the effect of that act. I do not wish to add anything in  relation to grounds two and three . I agree that the appeal on those grounds shoul d also  be dismissed for the reasons given by my Lord.   LADY CARR OF WALTON -ON-THE -HILL CJ   122. I also agree that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Lord Justice  Males .
