THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF      TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF  :   1. This group action rai ses the question whether an employer is liable, directly or  vicariously, for the criminal actions of a rogue employee in disclosing personal  information of co -employees on the web, whether under the Data Protection Act   1998, an action for breach of confide nce, or in an action for misuse of private  information.   2. On 12th January 2014 a file containing personal details of 99,998 employees of the  Defendant (“Morrisons”) was posted on a file sharing website.  Shortly after that ,  links to the website were also placed elsewhere on the web.  The data consisted of the  names, addresses, gender, dates of birth, phone numbers ( home or mobile) , national  insurance numbers, bank sort codes, bank account number s and the salary which the  employ ee in question was being paid.  On 13th March 2014,  a CD containing a copy  of the data was received by three newspapers in the UK, one of which was the  Bradford Telegraph and Argus, a newspaper local to Bradford where Morrisons has  its head office,  The person sending the CD did so anony mously, purporting to be a  concerned person who had worryingly discovered that payroll data  relating to almost  100,000 Morrisons employees was available on the web.  It gave a link to the file - sharing site.   3. The information was not published by any of the n ewspapers concerned . Instead,  the  Bradford Telegraph and Argus told Morrisons of it.  There was immediate concern.   Morrisons ’ annual financial reports were about to be announced.  The revelation of  this data, with its implication that Morrisons could not be trusted to keep data secure,  had serious implications for the share value of Morrisons.  Much more important,  though, was the immediate concern of the most senior managers within Morrisons  that the information might be used by outsiders to access the ba nk accounts of  individual  employee s (though  they were assured by banks over the next 2 or 3 days  this could not happen , without  yet more  information  being disclosed ) or used to aid  identity theft. It could enable intending fraudsters to phish for the addit ional  information to enable dishonest access to the employees ’ bank accounts, take out  loans, or make purchases under an assumed identity.   This was a serious risk.    4. Morrisons ’ head management was alerted to the disclosure on 1 3th March  2014 .   Within a fe w hours , they had taken steps to ensure that the website had been taken  down.  Such  links as there were to the file sharing  website from other sites were then   no longer effective in helping a searcher to discover any personal data. Morrisons also  alerted t he police .  It was rapidly established that the data, in the quantity and style in  which it was presented, had almost certainly been derived  from data held centrally by  Morrisons in relation to its employees, both present and, in some cases, past.  Only a  limited number of employees had been permitted access to the whole of this data ,  which was held  in a supposedly secure internal environment created by proprietary  software known as “ People Soft”.  It was possible to tell  when the data had been  extracted by comparing  the disclosed material  with the database :  the time s that  entries were made into the database or deletions made from it  were automatically  logged .  Thus, where data now on the database was not amongst that disclosed, this  suggested the disclosed data had been extracted bef orehand.   5. It was possible by this process  to show that the data held in PeopleSoft had been  copied during the afternoon of 14th November 2013.  It was then also possible to show TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       that at that time one of the “super users” (the name  for people who had access to the  whole of the People Soft database, as opposed  to having access only to that part which  related to them personally or, in some cases , to those employees under their line  managemen t) had extracted data corresponding to that d isclosed by means of an SQL  (structured language query) within the time period during which the data containing  the information disclosed must have been copied. This person was  Michael L eighton.   He was arrested on 17th March 2014.    6. Another employee – an investigator  – was also identified as a suspect. This was   because his initials and date  of birth appeared in the user name adopted for the  account which had been used in January 2014 to post the data  file onto the internet.    7. It very quickly emerged that M ichael Leig hton was not responsible for  disclosing the  file to the web,  and that where the initials and date of birth of the investigator had  been used this was in a deliberate attempt to frame him . He too  was completely  innocent.    8. On 19th March, Andrew S kelton , a Senior IT Auditor in Morrison s’ employment,  was  arrested.  He was charged with  an offence under the Computer Misuse Act 1990   both of fraud and under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act  1998, tried at  Bradford Crown Court in July 2015, and convi cted.  He was sentenced by the  Honorary Recorder of Bradford to a term of 8 years imprisonment, which he still  serves.    The Claim   9. 5,518 employees of Morrisons whose data was disclosed by the actions of Skelton on  12th January and 13th March 2014 claim com pensation  both for breach of statutory  duty (under Section 4(4) of the Data Protection Act 1998 ) and at common law (the  tort of misuse of private information, and equitable claim for breach of confidence).   The claims are put on the basis that Morrisons ha s both primary liability for their own  acts or omissions, and secondary (vicarious) liability for the actions of one of their  employ ees harming his fellow workers.   In respect of the Data Protection Act ,  primary liability is said to be absolute or strict, rather than a qualified liability only  arising if Morrisons failed to observe appropriate  standards: but if it should be held  that the Act does not impose an absolute liability, it is asserted that in any event  Morrisons failed to  observe those standards a nd is  liable on that alternative basis.   10. The trial has been concerned only with liability.  If the cour t should find in favour of  the C laimants in respect any of their heads of claim, quantum is to be assessed later.   Similarly, although in their pleadings the Claimants sought an injunction to prevent  Morrisons further disclosing the private and confidential information of the  Claimants, and an order under Section 14(4) of the Data Protection Act 1998   blocking each Claimant’s personal data, neither was pursu ed before me.  Accordingly,  since most of the facts were not in dispute (having been clarified by the criminal trial  and conviction of Skelton)  the hearing before me proceeded without any of the  Claimant s being called to give evidence: they knew little if anything as to how or why  the disclosure happened about which they were in a position to give first -hand  evidence.  That information lay in the hands of Morrisons, and the force of any  criticism of what happened, supportive of a case that Morrisons failed to observe  applicable standards, depended on evidence called by Morrisons.  Accordingly, TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       Morrisons called evidence from five members of senior management of Morrisons  (the evidence of a sixth, Ms Cro ssland, was taken as read) .  11. The parties have agreed that there are 14 issues of fact and law to determine, and set  them out in writing. Many of these are themselves subdivided into sub -issues.   The Central Facts   12. I shall first set out an overview of the facts which set the scene for the determination   of those issu es.  Mr. Barnes, with whom Ms Victoria Jolliffe appears for the  Claimants, argues that in a number of respects Morrisons fell short of a proper  standard (whether under the Data Protection Act  or common law): I shall deal with  my more detailed findings of fact when I consider each of those arguments later in  this judgment.   13. There is a statutory obligation resting on Morrisons to have their accounts audited  externally.  At the times relevant to this action, the external auditor was KPMG.  In  order to perform the audit, KPMG would , each year, request data so that it could test  the accuracy and reliability of the information produced to it.  In 2012 (and probably  earlier) it asked to have a copy of Morrisons’  payroll data so that the integrity of the  data could be assessed: pay roll expenses are a significant part of Morrisons’ accounts.   In 2012, amongst various other requests for information KP MG asked for a copy of  the “pay roll data” being the data from which the data in the file disclosed were  copied.  This wa s not the only data requested  by KPMG.   It was, however, the only  data to come from the People Soft system.    14. Morrisons had an internal audit team.  At the time of the disclosure, Mr Chowdhery  was its head.  It had within it an IT audit section.  That team was headed up by  Graham Daniels, who gave evidence before me.  Two or three IT auditors,  specifically recruited for the purpose by Mr Daniels, reported to him.  One of those  was Andrew Skelton  (“Skelton”) .    15. Skelton  was a senior IT internal auditor.  As su ch, his role involved speaking to  fellow employees about their work and processes, and obtaining sight of relevant  documents concerning them.  Some of those who se work  he had to audit would be  more senior than he was.  He was given the responsibility and a uthority to speak to  many colleagues and request sight of their documents.  He had to exercise diplomacy  and sensitivity, and would frequently be expected to gain access to and use  information that was sensitive, not only in a business sense, in that it wa s strictly  confidential for internal use only, but also potentially sensitive so far as  the colleagues  providing the information were concerned.  Colleagues had to feel that he was both  reliable and trustworthy.    16. As a senior IT auditor, he was highly IT l iterate, with a good technical understanding  of IT security issues, operating systems, user access and cryptography.    17. Unknown at the time to his employers, Skelton operated a sideline in dealing with a  slimming drug.  He bought quantities, probably in kil ograms, from a wholesaler, and  re-packaged these in smaller quantitie s which he offered for sale on e -Bay.  He  did  this in his own time, as a personal business. It has not been suggested that this was in  conflict with the business of Morrisons.   He did not  use Morrisons ’ facilities, except TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       on those occasions when , if he had not posted a package to a customer from a post  box or office  local to his home , he would put the p ackage through  Morrisons ’ post  room. When he did so, it had already been appropriately s tamped by him. No  dishonest y was involved: there was no direct cost to Morrisons.   18. The drug was Phenylalanine, a close analogue to Amphetamine.  Where as  Amphetamine is a class B drug, the supply of which is unlawful, the supply of  Phenylalanine is not.    19. On 20th May 2013, an envelope he had posted in this way came open in the post room  at Morrisons.  It contained white powder. This caused immediate alarm to those in the  post room, who did not know what the powder was, and who had a protocol for  dealing with such incidents.  The incident  might easily have led to the closure of the  post room in accordance with the protocol.  The police were called.  They suspected  the drug might be Amphetamine.  A field test at the local police station was indicative  of this.   Since there was no attempt to hide the identity of the sender , which was  mentioned  in documents within the package, it was clear that Skelton had sent it.  He  was arrested and escorted from the premises of Morrisons.  He was suspended  from  work , pending a definitive laboratory analysis of the powder.  It took just over a  month before the results of that were notified . They show ed that the drug was not  illegal . Accordingly Skelton, who had been on suspension throughout this period, was  permitted to return to  work . He did so  on 3rd July 2013.    20. However, Morrisons decided to discipline him for the incident, which had caused  considerable concern, and might well have led to the closing down of the post room  for a day with serious implications for the business.  O n 9th July 2013 he faced  a  disciplinary hearing, following which , on 18th July, he was given a formal verbal  warning.  Though this was described in witness evidence as the lowest level of  sanction within the disciplinary procedures, this is not quite so.  Morrisons ’  disciplinary code provided that where after a hearing it was concluded there had been  misconduct, possible outcomes began with informal action  which is plainly meant to  be less serious.   It is, however, correct to say  that formal action s availab le to the  employer began with a verbal warning , followed by a first written warning, a final  written warning , then dismissal on notice for the more serious cases, and summary  dismissal for the most serious.  It is worth noting for what follows that it is o nly in the  case of dismissal that the code provides for an alternative, lesser, sanction , that  of  demotion to a lesser position or transfer to an alternative role or department.  Though  described as a “verbal” warning, the essence of the warning was record ed in writing  in a letter written formally to Skelton , as was the practice. It was to stay on his file for  six months.    21. Skelton was unhappy that he had been given a formal, albeit “verbal” , warning, and  said as much to his line manager Graham Daniels.  Mr D aniels thought that Skelton  had been irritated by the fact he was given such a low level of sanction , since this  reinforced his (Skelton’s) view that Morrisons ’ initial reaction to the incident had  been excessive, even though he  (Skelton)  understood that a  disciplinary process had  been warranted.  He thought the sanction disproportionate , and exercised his right to  appeal.  The appeal came b efore Ms Joanna (“Jo”) Goff on 15th. August 2013 and was  rejected.  The disciplinary decision recited that Skelton’s ac tions had not been in  accordance with Morrisons ’ values.  Tho se values are set out in a hand book given to  all employees.  There are 6 of them: “Can Do”; “One Team”; “Bringing the Best out TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       of our People”; “Great Selling and Service”; “Great Shopkeeping”; an d “Fresh  Thinking”.   22. At his trial Mr Skelton denied being responsible for the data disclosure.  He did not  advance any reason for having acted as he did.  However, the Recorder of Bradford  had no doubt that it was the white powder incident which caused Skel ton to do as he  did.  When sentencing Skelton on 17th July 2015 he said:    “[the white powder incident]… was concluded against you, not  that in fact there was anything particular that happened by way  of discipline of you.  One would think that any sensible,   reasonable person would have just put that behind them and got  on with life and got on with their job.  That was not your  reaction.  Your reaction was to harbour a very considerable  grudge and harbour very considerable bad feelings towards  Morrisons.  Tha t much is evident if nothing else, from the  resignation letter that you drafted in November of that year, a  few months after the incident and disciplinary proceedings had  been concluded.  It was rankling very deeply and nastily with  you.    Your reaction wa s to set about, in October or November, doing  Morrisons some real damage, and you achieved that of course.   Over a period of months at the end of the year you set about  getting sensitive information from Morrisons – it came  legitimately into your hands, tr usted as you were in that IT  department – the pay roll details and personal details of all the  employees at Morrisons, who of course number over 100,000.   Having got hold of that material legitimately at work you took  it away from work electronically and y ou, in November and  December – so over a period of weeks, not just on the spur of  the moment – started to set up what you put into effect in 2014.   You created a false email account, you got a pay as you go  mobile telephone that could not [be] traced back to you, you  started to use the TOR system which we heard about which is a  way of seeking and achieving anonymity in terms of what you  were to do on the internet. …it was cold and calculating and  designed, no doubt, to do as much damage to Morrisons as  could be achieved.”   23. Not only did His Honour Judge Thomas QC, the Honorary Recorder , have the benefit  of hearing the evidence in the criminal trial which included that of Skelton himself ,  such that I would in any event pay great respect to his conclusions, but these findings  are also entirely consistent with the documentation before me.    24. On 9th October 2013, u nknown  to Morrisons , Skelton made a search for “TOR” on his  work computer.  The acronym stands for “The Onion Rou ter”: software which is  capable of disgui sing the individual identity of a computer which has accessed the  internet.   TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       25. On 1st. November, the external auditor , KPMG , requested a number of categories of  data from Morrisons.  This was held in different places. It was convenient that the  data be coll ated before transmission to KPMG.  The request came to Mr Daniels.  In  previous years Mr Dan iels had been charged by Mr Chow dhery , head of the team,  with arranging for the transmission of such data to the external auditor.  Mr Daniels  delegated the task in 2013 to Skelton, one of the two or three internal auditors who  reported to him, just as he had delegated an identical task  to Skelton (I find) in 2012.   Skelton in turn sent an email request to Dan Moore of t he HR department, who had  super -user access to Peopl eSoft.  He in turn delegated the task of extracting a copy of  the data , by me ans of an appropriate SQL query, to Michael Leighton.  On 14th  November, Michael Leighton obtained an electronic copy of the data.  This was in the  late afternoon.  He attemp ted to email the data internally to Skelton.  I find that the  transfer would have been secure if the internal email system had been able to cope  with the transfer of a data file of that size.  It was not . So, although Michael Leighton  completed documentati on suggestive that the transfer had been effective on 14th  November 2013, in fact the email “bounced back” to Michael Leighton’s computer.   Accordingly, the next day Michael Leighton copied the data from his computer onto a  USB stick . Insofar as it is in i ssue I find that the USB was encrypted (personal USB  sticks were not to be used; a limited number of USB sticks were made available to  senior employees, obviously for the transfer of data, and all were encrypted; the  overwhelming probability is that Michae l Leighton used one of these, and there is no  reason to suppose otherwise).  He took the USB stick personally to Skelton at his  laptop computer, which was itself encrypted.  He was present while the data was  downloaded from the stick onto the computer and he then returned with the USB stick  to the (nearby ) desk  from which he had come.    26. Skelton was supplied with a separate USB stick, from KPMG, encrypted by it, onto  which he later copied the data.  He had the task of collating the payroll data and other  data which had been requested by KPMG, which was not itself held on the PeopleS oft  system.  For that reason, the payroll data was not sent immediately  to KPMG , but  remained stored for the t ime being on Skelton’s computer.  The precise date on which  Skelton pro vided the pay roll data to KPMG on a KPMG USB (together, I assume,  with the other data he had collated) is not known.  It must, however, have fallen  between the 15th November (when he, Skelton , was supplied by Leighton with the  data) and 21st November.    27. On 18th. November 2013 it is agreed by the parties that an unknown USB device was  inserted into Skelton’s work laptop.  Various files which included the pay roll data  and the file later uploaded to the file sharing website  (which was termed the “FTSE  100” file) were deleted from the same USB on the 12th. March 2014 , using Skelton’s  personal computer to do so.   From this, limited, material, coupled with the knowledge  (it is agreed as fact) that on 14th November Skelton obtain ed the mobile phone he was  later t o use to facilitate the offending dat a disclosures, I infer that Skelton copied the  payroll data onto a personal USB at work on 18th. November 2013, and that this was a  step in his criminal conduct.  Given that in December the phone was registered with  an email address implicating the innocent investigator, and that it was not used until  the 12th. January when uploading data to the web, I infer that Skelton – who would  have known from his previous year’s experience what type of data he would be  dealing with  – had it in mind from before the 14th. November to misuse that data.  TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       28. The next incident of note before the uploading of the data to the file -sharing website  was on 16th. December 2013.  Skelton attempted to access  the TOR website  from his  work laptop.  Thi s was unknown to Morrisons until after it had come to light that the  employee details had been placed in a file on a file sharing website and copied t o  national and local newspapers, on respectively 12th. January and 13th. March 2014.     29. No point arises for  decision in respect of Morrisons’ reaction to the disclosures once it  knew of t hem.   30. Each employee had supplied the information later disclosed because it was required  by Morrisons upon that employee taking employment with them .  The Claimants’ Case   31. So far as direct, primary, liability is concerned, the Claimants made claims under the  Data Protection Act 1998 , under common law for misuse of private information, and  in equity, for breach of confidence.  If Morrisons were not held primarily liable, the  Claiman ts submitted they were liable vicariously, under each of the three heads .   I  shall deal with each of the claims in turn, beginning with the claims of primary  liability.   32. Ms Proops argued that there could be no primary liability for breach of confidence,  for Morrisons itself did not breach the confidence.   Data Protection Act 1998   33. The Data Protection Act (the “DPA”) provides, so far as ma terial as follows: By  section 1  (headed “Bas ic interpretative provisions”):   “(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires —  “data” means information which —  (a) is being processed by means of equipment operating automatically  in response to instructions given for that purpose,   (b) is recorded with the intention that it should be processed by means  of such equipment,   (c) is recorded as part of a relevant filing system or with the intention  that it should form part of a relevant filing system,   (d) does not fall within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) but forms part of an  accessible record as defined by section 68; ….   “data cont roller” means, subject to subsection (4), a person who (either alone  or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes  for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be,  processed;  TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       “data processor”, in relation to pers onal data, means any person (other than  an employee of the data controller) who processes the data on behalf  of the data controller;   “data subject” means an individual who is the subject of personal data    “personal data” means data which relate to a living  individual who     can be identified —  (a) from those data, or   (b) from those data and other information which is in the possession  of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller,   and includes any expression of opinion about the indivi dual and any  indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person  in respect of the individual;   “processing”, in relation to information or data, means obtaining,   recording or holding the information or data or carrying out any  operatio n or set of operations on the information or data, including —  (a) organisation, adaptation or alteration of the information or data,   (b) retrieval, consultation or use of the information or data,   (c) disclosure of the information or data by transmission,  dissemination or otherwise making available, or   (d) alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of the  information or data;    (2) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires —  (a) “obtaining” or “recording”, in relation to personal data, i ncludes  obtaining or recording the information to be contained in the data, and   (b) “using” or “disclosing”, in relation to personal data, includes using  or disclosing the information contained in the data.   (3) In determining for the purposes of this Act w hether any information is  recorded with the intention —  (a) that it should be processed by means of equipment operating  automatically in response to instructions given for that purpose, or   (b) that it should form part of a relevant filing system,   it is imma terial that it is intended to be so processed or to form part of  such a system only after being transferred to a country or territory  outside the European Economic Area.  TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment         ……………………”       34. By section 4 is provided, under the heading: “ The data protection princip les”  “4.—.  (1) References in this Act to the data protection principles are to the  principles set out in Part I of Schedule 1.   (2) Those principles are to be interpreted in accordance with Part II of  Schedule 1.   (3) ………..   (4) Subject to section 27(1), it s hall be the duty of a data controller to comply  with the data protection principles in relation to all personal data with respect  to which he is the data controller.”       35. Part I of Schedule 1 states, so far as relevant:   “SCHEDULE 1   The data protection princ iples   PART I   The principles   1. Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular,  shall not be processed unless —  (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and   (b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the   conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.   2. Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and  lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner  incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.   3. Personal data shall be adequate, r elevant and not excessive in relation  to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.   4. Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.  TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       5. Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept  for longer than is n ecessary for that purpose or those purposes.   6. Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data  subjects under this Act.   7. Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken  against unauthorised or unlawful processing of per sonal data and  against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal  data.”     35. The data protection principles are expanded by Part II of Schedule 1 as follows  (again, so far as material):   “The first principle   1.—  (1) In determining for the purpos es of the first principle whether personal  data are processed fairly, regard is to be had to the method by which they  are obtained, including in particular whether any person from whom they  are obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or purposes f or which  they are to be processed.   ………     2.—  (1) Subject to paragraph 3, for the purposes of the first principle personal  data are not to be treated as processed fairly unless —  (a) in the case of data obtained from the data subject, the data  controller ensu res so far as practicable that the data subject has,  is provided with, or has made readily available to him, the  information specified in sub -paragraph (3), and   (b) in any other case, the data controller ensures so far as  practicable that, before the relev ant time or as soon as  practicable after that time, the data subject has, is provided with,  or has made readily available to him, the information specified  in sub -paragraph (3).   ……………     (3) The information referred to in sub -paragraph (1) is as follows, nam ely—  (a) the identity of the data controller,   (b) if he has nominated a representative for the purposes of this  Act, the identity of that representative,   (c) the purpose or purposes for which the data are intended to be  processed, and   (d) any further infor mation which is necessary, having regard to  the specific circumstances in which the data are or are to be  processed, to enable processing in respect of the data subject to  be fair.   ………….    TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       The second principle   5.  The purpose or purposes for which personal d ata are obtained may in  particular be specified —  (a) in a notice given for the purposes of paragraph 2 by the  data controller to the data subject, or   (b) in a notification given to the Commissioner under Part III  of this Act.   6.  In determining whether any disclosure of personal data is compatible with  the purpose or purposes for which the data were obtained, regard is to be  had to the purpose or purposes for which the personal data are intended to  be processed by any person to whom they are disclosed.     …………     The seventh principle   9.  Having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of  implementing any measures, the measures must ensure a level of security  appropriate to —  (a) the harm that might result from such unauthorised or  unlawful pro cessing or accidental loss, destruction or damage as  are mentioned in the seventh principle, and   (b) the nature of the data to be protected.”     36. As to the consequence of any breach of the duty to observe these principles, section  13 provides:   “13.— Compensat ion for failure to comply with certain requirements.   (1) An individual who suffers damage by reason of any contravention  by a data controller of any of the requirements of this Act is entitled  to compensation from the data controller for that damage.   …………. .  (3) In proceedings brought against a person by virtue of this section it  is a defence to prove that he had taken such c are, as in all the  circumstances, was reasonably required to comply with the  requirement concerned.”     37. Of relevance to the present claim  is that data is “information”: it is plain that a  principal thrust of the Act concerns data electronically held, as was the information in  respect of the employees’ identities as set out above.  What is important for what  follows are the definitions of “d ata controller”, “data processor” as set out above, and TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       Section 1(2) which provides that unless the context otherwise requires “disclosing” in  relation to personal data, includes disclosing the information contained in the data.   38. The Claimant s argue  that Se ction 4(4) places a duty on a data controller to comply  with the data protection principles in relation to all personal data with respect to  which he is data controller.  Here, the Claimants say Morrisons were at all relevant  times the data controller in r espect of the payroll data abstracted from PeopleSoft by  Michael Leighton and transferred to Skelton.  They assert that Morrisons did not  comply with data protection principles 1, 2,  3, 5 and 7 .    39. For DPP 1 to be satisfied certain conditions are to be met b efore the da ta may be  regarded as being p rocessed fairly and lawfully.  The first of those conditions, to be  found in DPA schedule 2, is that the data subject has given his consent to the  processing.  That did not happen, because none of the Claimants cons ented to Skelton  processing the data by copying it, processing the original data so as to produce an  extract of the information of which the original data consisted, and then sending that  extract to the file sharing website.    40. They claim, too, that DPP 2 wa s not complied with because the data was processed not  only for administration, payroll and audit purposes, but for the criminal purposes  known only to Skelton. They assert that what happened was thus processing in a  manner incompatible with the purposes f or which the data was obtained from them.   41. DPP3 requires that “personal data are not excessive”.  Beyond complaining that this  principle was broken, the Claimants’ argument in court did not further amplify the  way in which the data they provided to Morriso ns was “excessive”: on the face of it, it  was exactly the sort of payroll information which almost any employer is likely to  require, and then to hold. Only a little more was said as to the claim in respect of  DPP5 - that personal data are not to be kept f or longer than necessary for the purpose  or purposes for which they have been obtained.  Insofar as Morrisons were concerned,  it was thought necessary to keep the information in the hands of Skelton, as Morrisons  thought securely, for a short period after transfer to KPMG: there might need to be  queries raised, which it would be easier and more efficient for Skelton to answer from  the material stored on his work laptop rather than have once again to request a  superuser to conduct an SQL request to identify the data again, and transfer it once  more to him. I accept the Defendant’s evidence that if the system had required such  requests and answers it would have incurred the additional risk inherent in any  transfer of data out of the secure environment of Peopl eSoft to a laptop, even if  encrypted.   I find that to do as was done was thus, if marginally, the safer option.   42. Although Section 13 of the Act provides that it will be a defence (the burden of  proving which rests upon the Defendant) to show that all reason able care was taken  by the Defendant to satisfy the data protection principles, the Defendants have not  relied upon this defence.  In the absence of their doing so, there could be no defence  to a claim i f it were shown that any of DPP 1, 2,  3 or 5 were brok en.  As to DPP 7,  there would be a breach if there were a failure to apply appropriate technological or  organisational measures to prevent the disclosure or loss in question.  It is thus  necessary to determine what the scope of “appropriate” measures are, a n inquiry  necessarily related to the particular facts of the particular case.   TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       43. Ms Proops QC, who appears with Mr Paines for Morrisons, makes a case that they do  not need to avail themselves of the defence in section 13 to avoid primary liability.  This is because the structure of the Act places the responsibilities created by DPP 1-8  upon the data controller, as defined.  She argues that data is not the same as  “propert y”.  It consists of information:  information is not the same as property.   If  information  is seen and copied, it is not sensible to talk of the information as having  been “stolen”: unless it is deleted at the same time as it is copied it remains on the  database from which the information was extracted.  At any one time there may be  many sets o f data containing precisely the same information .  In Your Response Ltd  v Data Team Business Media Ltd  [2014] EWCA Civ 281, it was held that the  concept of possession in the conventional sense had no meaning in relation to  intangible property, and it was t hus not possible for a lien to exist over an electronic  database.  At paragraph 42 of the judgment Floyd LJ noted that although information  may give rise to intellectual property rights the law has been reluctant to treat  information itself as property.  T he court declined to do so in the case before it; in the  words of Moore -Bick LJ (paragraph 19) the process of entering information into an  electronic data storage system :-  “…does not in my view render the information itself a physical object  capable of pos session independently of the medium in which it is held  and in the electronic world the distinction is of some importance  because of the ease of making and transmitting intangible copies.”      44. This conceptu al understanding of information as being distinct f rom tangible property  helps to explain the way in which the Data Protection Act 1998  is structured.  The  duties under section 4, and generally within the Act, are imposed upon a data  controller, even if a third party may be guilty of a criminal offence und er section 55 of  the Act as was Skelton here.  In Ittihadieh v 5 -11 Cheyne Gardens RTM Company  Ltd [2017] EWCA Civ 121, in the course of considering a case which centred upon  the law relating to subject access requests  under the DPA , the court had to decid e (as  an issue) the scope of the definition of “personal data” in Section 1 of the DPA, and  the question who was a “data controller” (see paragraph 1(i) and (ii) of the judgment).   In a judgment with which Lloyd -Jones and McCombe L.JJ agreed Lewison LJ sai d at  paragraph 70 and 71, under the heading “who is a data controller?” as follows:   “70.  A data controller is a person who makes decisions about  how and why personal data are processed.  It is clear from the  terms of section 7(1)(a) that the data control ler is responsible  for persons who process data on his behalf.  Thus it follows  that a person who processes data as agent for a data controller  is not himself a data controller in respect of those data.  Even  where decisions about data are taken by natural  persons, they  will not themselves be data controllers if those decisions are  made as agents of a company of which they are directors: Re  Southern Pacific Personal Loans Ltd   [2013] EWHC 2485  (Ch);   71. On the other hand, if they are processing personal dat a  on their own behalves they will be data controllers as regards TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       that processing and those data.  The question may then arise  whether they are entitled to one or more exemptions under the  DPA.”   45. Mr Barnes, appearing with Ms Jolliffe for the Claimants, said expressly in closing that  he took no issue with the general terms in which  those two paragraphs  are expressed .   Moreover, since the reasoning concerned one of the issues in the case, the view  expressed binds me.  In any event, I consider it flows from the way in which the Act  is structured, and if it had mattered I would independently have been of the same view  as the Court.   46. In closing, Mr Barnes thus accepted that if Company A copied data which it held as  data controller, and transmitted that copy to Comp any B, then if Company B did not  handle that data in accordance with any one of the data protection principles,  Company B would be liable.  It would be liable alone, unless it were to process the  data for Company A, for it would now be the data controller in respect of the data  copied to it : Company A would not. The fact that Company A would remain data  controller of the data from which the copy was made would be beside the point.  Bringing the example more closely to the facts of the present case, when Skel ton  transferred a copy of the data he had been given by Leighton from his work laptop  onto the USB stick given him by KPMG, and that data was taken to KPMG, KPMG  alone were the data controller in respect of the information contained on that data set.   Of course, Morrisons remained the data controller in respect of precisely the same  information on their own equipment.   Mr Barnes accepted that for the purpose of the  case in relation to vicarious liability which he sought to advance, he could only do so  unde r the DPA if Skelton were a data controller, in respect of the data eventually  disclosed on to the web, for only as such would Skelton owe any duty himself which  might result in Morrisons having secondary liability  for his wrongs .  Yet for him to be  data c ontroller in respect of that data would put him in no different a position, in my  view, from the position occupied respectively by Company B or KPMG in the two  examples just given.    47. Ms Proops ’ submissions are entirely in line with this approach. She submi ts that  Morrisons owed duties under Section 4(4) DPA only while data controller, and only  qua data controller. Skelton became data controller i n respect of that information   once he  put hims elf in the position  of determining the purposes for which and the  manner in which the personal data he was about to copy from his laptop was to be  handled.  When he decided to settle his grudge against Morrisons by means of  disclosing it, eventually, on the internet, he was acting just for himself. He was in the  same pos ition as the hypothetical individual considered in paragraph 71 of Ittihadieh .  48. Mr Barnes argues that if a data controller may only be held liable if it has contravened  its statutory obligations under the DPA , Ms Proops’ analysis would have a data  controlle r complying with the DPA through the actions of its employees, but never  being in breach of its obligations should an employee misuse data.  He submits t his  would make a nonsense of the statutory scheme, for a data controller could simply  disown any act of  its employee which if attributed to it would put it in breach of  statutory duty. Instead, to be effective the statutory scheme itself should impute to a  non-natural data controller the data processing actions (good or bad) of its employees.  TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       49. I cannot accep t this. Not only do I see no reason why, if it is sound, the principle  should not apply to natural persons as well as corporate bodies, for both may have  employees, and both may act through them, but at its heart is the contention that upon  its true constr uction the Act imposes liability on a data controller not only for those  breaches it has authorised or facilitated (acting, if a corporation, by individuals to do  so) but also for those it has n either facilitated nor authorised. Indeed, it may have  taken g reat pains to avoid  doing so .  If a corporation (or individual) is to be liable for  breaches which it is in no sense responsible for either authorising or requiring, but  which are committed by employees acting in contravention of its wishes, that liability   may be established vicariously - but not directly.   50. Untrammelled by the question whether the European origins of th e DPA require me to  interpret the S tatute to hold that when Skelton copied the data unlawfully onto a  personal USB stick Morrisons remained primarily liable  for this . I would reject the  Claimants’ case in respect of direct liability under the DPA.  I would hold the wording  of the Statute, interpreted as it was in Ittihadieh , to be such that Morrisons (a) were  not the data controller a t the tim e of any breach of DPP 1, 2, 3 and 5 in respect of the  information later disclosed on the web, and that (b) since they were not the data  controller in relation to it owed no duty to the Claimants in respect of which they were  in breach, unless it were the d uty to comply with DPP7.   51. Although little was said about it d uring the trial, the fact that t he DPA was enacted in  order to  implement a European Directive nonetheless cannot be ignored. A Directive  obliges Member States to whom it is addressed to achieve th e results it directs.  The  obligation resting upon a domestic court when interpreting national legislation which  implements a D irective is thus to achieve a conforming interpretation: to interpret it  “as far as possible” in the light of the wording and pur pose of the directive to achieve  the result sought by the lat ter: see Marleasing v LA Comercial Internacional de  Alimentación SA  (1992) 1 CMLR 305, and Pfeiffer v Deutscher Rotes Kreuz  Kreisverband Waldshut eV  [2005] ICR 1307.  Accordingly I have to ask wh ether it  requires an interpretation other than that I have already indicated. The linguistic  features of the legislation are not conclusive.  The effect of interpretation may be to  change the meaning of legislation in order to correspond with the purpose o f the  European law concerned.  But the court is not a legislator.  There is a critical  difference between interpretation on the one hand and legislation on the other.  Thus  in Ghaidan v Godin -Mendoza  [2004] 2 AC 557 HL it was accepted that the  interpretati on chosen by a court must “go with the grain of the legislation” for this  would be consistent with the legislative purpose, whereas going against that grain  would constitute the court a law maker.  Lord Nichol ls, Lord Steyn and Lord Rodger  all accepted tha t there would be occasions when the courts could not adopt a  conforming interpretation because that would involve making policy choices which  the court was not equipped to make.  (Though Ghaidan  concerned the European  Convention of Human Rights, it is now well recognised that the principles relating to  interpretation in conformity with a Directive are not materially different.)   52. The scope of the Directive, with a view to determining whether section 13 of the DPA  was in conformity with it, came for considerat ion before the Court of Appeal in  Vidal -Hall v Google inc  [2015] EWCA Civ 311, [2016] QB 1003.  In the joint  judgment of Lord Dyson MR and Sharpe LJ, with which McFarlan e LJ agreed, the  court rejected an appeal against a decision of Tugendhat J at first in stance.  There TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       were two issues – the first whether the cause of action for misuse of private  information is a tort (to which I shall return later in this judgment for other purposes)  and, the second the meaning of “damage” in Section 13 of the DPA.  As for  the  second issue, the court had necessarily to decide whether the DPA could be  interpreted such that “damage” included non -pecuniary loss, such as stress.    53. The Court noted that the DPA was intended to implement Directive 95/46/EC of 24th  October 1995, a Directive “on the protection of individuals with regard to the  processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data”.  At paragraph 56  Dyson MR and Sharpe LJ said:   “The Directive as a whole is aimed at safe -guarding privacy rights in  the conte xt of data management.  This is repeatedly emphasised in the  recitals:   “(2) Whereas data -processing systems are designed to serve man;  whereas they must, whatever the nationality or residence of natural  persons, respect their fundamental rights and freedo ms, notably the  right to privacy, and contribute to economic and social progress,  trade expansion and the well -being of individuals;…”   …(7) Whereas the difference in levels of protection of the rights and  freedoms of individuals, notably the right to priva cy, with regard to  the processing of personal data afforded in the Member States may  prevent the transmission of such data from the territory of one  Member State to that of another Member State; whereas this  difference may therefore constitute on obstacle to the pursuit to a  number of economic activities at Community level, distort  competition and impede authorities in discharge of their  responsibilities under Community law; whether this difference in  levels of protection is due to the existence of a wide v ariety of  national laws, regulations and administrative provisions…   …(10) Whereas the object of the national laws on the processing of  personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably  the right to privacy, which is recognised both in Ar ticle 8 of the  European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and  Fundamental Freedoms  o mom the general principles of  Community law; whereas, for that reason, the approximation of  those laws must not result in any lessening of the protection they   afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of  protection in the Community;..   …(11) Whereas the principles of the protection of the rights and  freedoms of individuals, notably the right to privacy, which are  contained within this Directi ve, give substance to and amplify those  contained in the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981  for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic  Processing of Personal Data…   Article 1 provides for the object of the Directive  TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       “1. I n acco rdance with this Directive Member States shall protect  the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in  particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of  personal data.”  ”   54. The Court  held that from this material it emerged th at the purpose of the DPA was to  “provide a high level of protection to the right of privacy in respect of the  management of personal data by data controllers”.  To achieve that purpose, the court  considered that Section 13(2) of the Act should be disapplie d: the Marleasing   principle did not permit an interpretation of “damage” which would be consistent with  it: a restriction to pecuniary loss , which the use of that word conveyed,  was an  important element of the compensation provisions that Parliament had en acted.  The  importance to the scheme of the Act as a whole of the provisions for compensation, in  the event of any contravention by a data controller, within the limits set by Parliament  to the right to compensation, made them a fundamental feature of the legislation.  Yet  given the purpose and meaning of the Directive it could only properly be  implemented if “damage” permitted non -pecuniary harm, such as distress and loss of  autonomy over personal data , to be the subject of compensation .   55. Just as was the c ase in Vidal -Hall where the court had to ask whether it was  necessary to interpret the legislative provisions to achieve the purpose of the Directive  it had identified and, if they could not be so interpreted, to disapply them, I have to  ask in the present  case whether it is contrary to the purpose of the Directive to hold  that the processing of employee data in a manner unauthorised by those employees is  something  for which Morrisons  is not liable. If it is,  I should either find a way of  interpreting the D PA to fulfil the purpose, or must disapply the relevant provisions.  This is so  even if, upon a literal reading of the Act it were to be held that the natural  reading of the Act excluded liability where the processing concerned was by the act of  a third par ty, contrary to the desires of Morrisons, nor authorised by it nor by any of  its employees in authority.   56. The effect of so holding would, as Ms Proops points out, amount to absolute or strict  liability dependent only upon the fact that information supplied to Morrisons had been  disclosed subsequently on the internet.    57. I accept both that where an Act of Parliament is the domestic implementation of an  E.U. Directive a court should take a purposive approach to the interpretation of that  legislation, and that t he purpose is that to be found in the Directive.  I accept too (it is  in any event binding upon me ) that the purpose is as described in Vidal -Hall.  I  cannot, however, construe either the Directive or the Act as requiring a data controller  to be responsibl e even without fault for the subsequent disclosure by a third party of  some of the information given to it.  This is because alt hough the directive has  as its  principal purpose the safe -guarding of the rights of data subjects, the recitals do not  suggest t hat once a person holds information relating to others as a data controller that  person is automatically to be liable for any disclosure by a person who is not acting on  behalf of the data controller in making it.     58. Recital 25 to the Directive provides tha t:  “Whereas the principles of protection must be reflected, on the one hand, in  the obligations imposed on persons, public authorities, enterprises, agencies TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       or other bodies responsible for processing, in particular regarding data  quality, technical securi ty, notification to the supervisory authority, and the  circumstances under which processing can be carried out, and, on the other  hand, in the right conferred on individuals, the data on whom are the subject  of processing to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the  data, to request corrections and even to object to proce ssing in certain  circumstances… ”       Recital 46 reads:    “Whereas the protection of rights and freedoms of data subjects with regard  to the processing of personal data req uires that appropriate technical and  organisational measures are taken, both at the time of the design of the  processing system and at the time of the processing itself, particularly in  order to maintain security and thereby prevent any unauthorised proces sing;  whereas it is incumbent on the Member States to ensure that controllers  comply with these measures; whereas these measures must ensure an  appropriate level of security, taking into account the state of the art and the  costs of their implementation in  relation to the risks inherent in the  processing and the nature of the data to be protected”;       And Recital 55 says:    “Whereas, if the controller fails to protect the rights of data subjects,  national legislation must provide for a judicial remedy; whe reas any damage  that a person may suffer as a result of unlawful processing must be  compensated for by the controller, who may be exempted from liability if he  proves that he is not responsible for the damage, in particular in cases where  he establishes fa ult on the part of the data subject or in case of force majeure ;  whereas sanctions must be imposed on any person, whether governed by  private or public law, who fails to comply with the national measures taken  under this Directive…”   These recitals recognis e the differing levels of protection in Member States; the  possibility of force majeure , as it is termed, causing problems for data security; and  the risks inherent in data processing.  The y do not speak of a need absolutely  to  prevent unlawful processing (which would have been all too easy to prescribe if it had  been intended) but rather to take “ap propriate” measures against it.     59.  The definition of “controller” in the Articles of the Directive is effectively that  adopted by the 1998 Act.  A “third party”  is defined as (Article 2f)   “Any natural or legal person public authority, agency or any other  body other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the  person who, under the direct authority of the controller or the  processor, are authorise d to process the data”     60. In Article 6(1), under “General Rules and the Lawfulness of the Processing of  Personal Data” are specified 5 data principles corresponding to data protection TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       principles 1 -5 in the 1998 Act, it being provided by Article 6(2) that “it  shall be for  the controller  to ensure that paragraph 1 [i.e. Article 6(1)] is complied with”  (emphasis added).   61. Article 17, headed “Security of Processing”, which relates most directly to the risk of  unauthorised disclosure by the actions of someone who is  not acting on behalf of the  specific authority of the controller, reads:   “Member States shall provide that the controller must implement  appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal  data against accidental or unlawful destruction or against accidental  loss or alteration unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where  the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and  against all other unlawful forms of processing.   Having regard to the state of the art and t he cost of their  implementation, such measures shall ensure a level of security  appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of  the data to be protected.”      62. These recitals and provisions demonstrate that t he obligation is placed by  the  Directive upon the “controller”, and that absolute liability for a disclosure was not  contemplated by the Directive itself. Counsel between them can point to no case in  which it has been held that the DPA imposes obligations which result in absolute o r  strict liability.   63. Such a uthority as there is also s upports an approach which would deny absolute  liability.  In Swinney v Chief Constable of Northumbria  (1999) 11 Admin L.R. 811  a claim was brought under the Data Protection Act 1984  – and for brea ch of  confidence – when a brief case containing information relating to a murder enquiry  was stolen from a police car, even though the car had been locked and the brief case  placed under the driver’s seat, at a time when the officers concerned were  investigating another matter.  Jackson J, as he then was, held that the phrase  “reasonable care” properly limited the extent  of the duty.  Though the 1984 S tatute  was a predecessor of the 1998 Act, and the latter must be construed independently of  its 1984 predecessor s ince the origin of the 1998 Act is in the Directive, Mr Barnes  conspicuously did not argue that in “Swinney -type circumstances” a data controller  would be liable.  He attempted to draw a distinction between actions such as hacking,  a Swinney -type loss of d ata, or unlawful copying of data by an intruder to the  premises where it was kept, on the one hand (where, on his submissions, the data  controller would not be held liable provided adequate technological and  organisational measures had been taken to safegu ard against them) and circumstances  such as those in the present case on the other, by arguing that in those examples the  third party was an outsider.  It was different, he submitted, where the person acting  unlawfully and without authority was an insider.   Ms Proops QC correctly argues that  this is an unprincipled distinction.  Insofar as an “insider” (such as an employee of the  data controller) processes data unlawfully because that is what he has been told by the  data controller to do, or where because h e is lawfully authorised to do so by the data  controller, his actions are not those of a third party at all.  They are in law the actions TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       of the data controller itself.  I agree. If there is to be liability for the actions for an  “insider” of this type, ra ther than an “outsider”, this liability must in my view rest  upon the principles of vicarious liability to which I shall turn later in this judgment.   64. The short answer therefore, to the claim that Morrisons are liable under the Data  Protection Act  for havin g broken the data protection principles (othe r than DPP 7) is  that they did not, as data controller, themselves offend against those principles.  The  acts said to break those principles were those of a third party, and not their own.   65. Similarly, the assertio n that there is direct liability in respect of breach of confidence  or misuse of private information also fails: it was not Morrisons that disclosed the  information or misused it: it was Skelton, acting without authority and criminally.   66. DPP7, however, rais es different issues, to which I now turn.    DPP7   67. The seventh principle does not impose a duty to take “reasonable care” as such. Th ose  words do not appear in the S tatute. This might suggest that the draftsman was aiming  at a rather different target when he  required that “appropriate” measures be taken.  This word comes from the Directive: it is likely therefore to bear an autonomous  meaning, which will apply in each Member State of the EU to whom it is addressed.  However, it is clear that the principle is a qualified one. The mere fact of disclosure or  loss of data is not sufficient for there to be a breach.  Rather, “appropriate” sets a  minimum standard  as to the  security which is to be achieved. This is expressly subject  to both the state of technological d evelopment and the cost of measures.  Thus, the  fact that a degree of security may technologically be achievable, which has not been  implemented, does not of itself amount to  failure to reach an appropriate standard : an  example might be if particular secur ity measures might be introduced which are very  costly at the present stage of  development, whereas after a few more years the cost  might reduce significantly, as is the case with many new technologies.  However, the  following words in DPP7 indicate that a  balance has to be struck between the  significance of the cost of preventative measures and the significance of the harm  that  might arise if they are not taken.  This is itself intended to be a combination of the  nature of the harm in itself and the importa nce of the data to be safeguarded from that  harm.   68. Though, as I have pointed out, the words “reasonable care” are not employed, there is  a resonance here of the common law approach to the tort of negligence, where the  standard of reasonable care is to be ju dged by balancing the magnitude of the risk of  the activity in question  (itself a combination of the likelihood of injury and the  severity of it should it occur) against the availability and cost of measures to prevent  the risk materialising , and the impor tance of the object to be achieved by performing  those actions.   That approach is accordingly indicative of the standard which should  apply here, whilst remaining mindful that it is being applied in the field of data  protection and it is , in general terms , of considerable importance that data be kept  secure.   69. Mr Barnes was at pains in closing to remind me that the claim was not a collective  one, but rather the claims of several individuals, each of whom uniquely had suffered  distress and loss of control over  their data.  In terms of applying the principle, TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       however, I have to bear in mind that a breach in respect of any one was likely to give  rise not only to the loss or disclosure of that individual’s own data, but also of  personal information relating to man y more.  In short, I would expect a higher  standard to be observed as to the measures appropriate to protect data relating to  100,000 employees than I would expect in respect of a small enterprise employing 6  or 7 workers.  Indeed, with economies of scale,  measures that might be prohibitively  expensive if analysed per head of a small workforce may seem relatively insignificant  if spread over the headcount of a large corporate employer. The magnitude of the risk  is greater; the cost per head of guarding agai nst it is less.   Applying DPP7 to the Facts   70. DPP7 stands apart from DPP 1, 2, 3 and 5 in that Morrisons were undoubtedly the data  controller in respect of the relevant information at the time when the duty fell to be  discharged.  If appropriate technical and organisational measures were not taken by  Morrisons against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data then provided  that the Claimants could show that th at breach of that duty had caused the disclosure  which is central to their complaints liabil ity would be made out.    71. The Claimants’ case is set out in paragraph 25 of the Particulars of Claim.  Mr Barnes  submits centrally that it was inappropriate to entrust Mr Skelton with the task of  acting as the “middle man” between the sources of information  internal to Morrisons  required for audit, and KPMG to whom the information was to be submitted.  This  was not a submission that it was inappropriate to have a trusted human being  occupying the role which Skelton did: a matter confirmed by agreed fact 20, that “…it  would have been unobjectionable for the Defendant to have used what they refer to as  a “trusted employee” to assist with the process of conveying data to KPMG so far as  necessary.”  The reason why Skelton was inappropriate on the Claimants’ case was  that he had not yet been rehabilitated from very recent disciplinary sanction and was ,  to the knowledge of the Defendants , unhappy with the way in which the Defendant  had dealt with the investigation and disciplinary process.  Secondly, the Claimants  aver that inadequate steps were taken to ensure that the data, stored for the purpose of  copying and onward transmission to KP MG on Skelton’s laptop, was deleted from it  within a short time after that transfer.   72. Allied to those two central points, the Claima nts questioned the manner of  transmission of the data to Skelton.  It was provided on what was said to be a n  “…openly readable and transportable USB memory stick as opposed to, for example  by secure password protected email.”  (Particulars of Claim paragra ph 25.1.1);  there  was no adequate management or mentoring of Skelton following the disciplinary  process such that he was likely to b ear a grudge against the Defenda nt and his co - workers (25.1.4),  Morrisons ought to have discovered that he “subsequently”  researched the  TOR network on his work laptop; Morrisons  failed to supervise,  mentor or monitor him so as to prevent his dealing with the information and  ultimately disclosing it; and that Morrisons’ system should have detected the attempt  to send a large fi le by email from Leighton to Skelton on 14th November 2013.  If it  had done, “competent investigations would inevitably have identified the obvious risk  in exposing the Claimants said information to Mr Skelton” (25.2.2).   73. These contentions became six issues : whether Morrisons fell short of thei r obligations  under DPP 7 by: - TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       a) failing to manage/mentor Skelton “to prevent a grudge developing”;   b) failing to monitor the email “quarantine” area so as to identify that the  data was being transferred to Skelton;   c) failin g to identify that Skelton was researching the “TOR” network;   d) failing to deny Skelton access to the data ;  e) providing the data to Skelton via USB stick which it was alleged was  not encrypted; and   f) failing to ensu re that Skelton deleted the pay roll data (in th e particulars  of claim, the Claimants asserted it ought to have been effective on or  about 21st November).   74. There is no other respect in which it is contended that Morrisons fell short of their  obligations in respect of DPP7.   The System G enerally   75. The pay roll data was held on the People Soft system.  Any individual had access to  their own personal details; managers had access to their own personal details and  those of the employees who reported directly to them.  No one apart from the   approximately  22 “super u sers” had unfettered access to the data.  The existence of  any one  super  user inevitably posed a risk that that person might deliberately or  inadvertently disclose data unlawfully.  Nonetheless, the Claimants did not criticise  this provision, and it is dif ficult to see how a large commercial organisation such as  Morrisons could function without permitting a number of individuals to have access  to significant pers onal data such as that on a pay roll file.  The case proceeded on the  basis that because access  was limited, and in any event any use of that access could be  tracked (as proved to be the case when Michael Leighton was identified as the  individual who had run an SQL query to identify data which was then transmitted to  Skelton)  the system was appropriat ely secure .    76. Simon Langley, Chief Information Security Officer told me in evidence that it is  impossible for any sizeable data controller completely to exclude the risk that data  may be compromised , for example as a result of a criminal hack of its IT sys tems or  the criminal misuse of data by its own employees.  In his witness statement  (paragraph 14) he said “there is in truth no impregnable system of information  security, and even the most intensive state -run security systems are always going to be  vulne rable to criminal intrusion or criminal exploitation by insiders as has been shown  by data loss at the NSA and intrusions into the systems of the FBI.”  He saw his role  as to assist the data controller (Morrisons) to manage such risks in its operations  through the application of appropriate and otherwise proportionate controls.  He  recognised that the hardest vulnerability to guard against was that of a person with  authorised access behaving in a criminal manner.    77. Much of the content of the witness stateme nts of the witnesses called by the  Defendant  - Daniel Moore,  currently “people manager – systems and analytics ”, who  was HR systems manager at the time relevant to the claim; Gordon Graham Daniels , TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       an internal IT auditor to whom Skelton reported;  Jo Goff, Group financial controller  who was interim financial controller at the relevant time and who heard Skelton’s  appeal against his disciplinary sanction; and Alison Charnock, Senior legal officer  -  expressed their personal views as to the merits of aspects of  the claims.  Yet n o order  was made or sought, prior to  or at  trial, in respect of expert evidence.  Insofar as the  evidence is of opinion I have therefore disregarded it, save where the fact that a  witness was of that opinion is a material fact in underst anding or explaining their  relevant actions. I have thus relied upon their witness statements for evidence of fact,  including those occasions when their view of matters at the relevant time amounts to a  fact – for instance, Mr Daniels’ view of the reliabil ity of Skelton and Ms Goff’s view  as to the merits of the appeal.  The statement of Lindsey Clair e Crossland, director of  risk and  internal audit was unchallenged, and before me on paper only.  She was not  appointed to full -time service in Morrisons until after the trial and conviction of  Skelton.  However, she tells me at paragraph 35 that it would not have occurred to her  to subject Mr Skelton to overt or covert monitoring of his IT usage.  Nor would she  have considered it appropriate.  Being unchallenged , I have accepted that evidence.   78. In general, I accept that each of the witnesses did their best to give me an honest and  considered account.  Mr Daniels was the only witness whose credibility Mr Barnes  challenged in closing.  I shall deal with that below: in the event, the criticism was  more of his reliability of recollection than the credibility of his account.   79. In summary, in any system which permits human access to data there are inevitably  risks that that data might be mis -processed, mishandled, or even disclosed without  authority.  The evidence is that  Morrisons took precautions to prevent that so far as  they could by limiting access to a few trusted employees only.  I am satisfied that the  data was protected by restrictions on access, and there were suf ficient internal checks  available to see wh ich of the few authorised super  users had access to the data any  more generally than to inquire about their own particulars.    80. The process which led to the disclosure by Skelton involved the transfer to him of  data.  I accept the evidence of Mr Langley  that to extract data from the People Soft  database, and store it temporarily on the work laptop of an internal auditor (leave  aside, for the moment, the identity of that person) left that data  no less secure  than it  had been while held in PeopleSoft .  That is because such a  laptop was itself  encrypted , and in addition accessible only to one person – he or she who held the  encryption key.  In setting out the background facts at the start of this judgment , I  have already  determined that in this case the transfer from Michael  Leighton to  Skelton was secure: the USB was encrypted, and  Mr Leighton took the USB away  with him after transfer, which he saw  taking place .  Moreover, even if the method of  transfer had been insecure  there is nothing in this case to suggest that that in any way  caused  the unauthorised disclosure of information contained in the data onto the web  in January 2014.  I accept that storing the data upon a collator’s individual computer ,  whilst all the data subject to the request from the various sources was collated there,  was a sensible system a nd necessary to provide for an e ffective audit, enabling the  auditors at KPMG to raise queries as to any of the data, and to channel them through  one contact .  The d ata so held would, on an encrypted work laptop, be secure.  The  transfer from a collator of information by downloading it onto a USB stick provided  by KPMG and encrypted by them equally gave rise to a risk  of data corruption or leak  which was merely minima l.   TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       81. As to the deletion thereafter, I accept that data had to remain on the work laptop of the  collator for a sufficient period to enable any potential requests for further information  from the external auditor to be serviced.  Since th e work of audit was likely to be  completed by early December I would not have considered it unreasonable for that  data to have remained on the laptop of the collator concerned until then.    82. It follows that, seen in broad overview, and save for two matters, namely the identity   of Skelton himself as the recipient of the information, and the question of whether in  his case  deletion from his computer should have been more carefully checked , there  was no failure of Morrisons to provide adequate and appropriate controls.  I shall de al  with these specific issues below.   Should M orrisons Have Entrusted Skelton with the D ata?  83. It is in dispute between the parties whether Morrisons knew or ought reasonably have  known that Mr Skelton posed a real risk to the security of the payroll data tra nsmitted  to him.    84. Mr Daniels interviewed Mr Skelton before he took up his post with Morrisons  in the  beginning of November 2010.  He thought him able, competent and suitable for the  post of a senior IT internal auditor, used to dealing with the complexit y of  infrastructure and systems of a large corporate organisation.  It is probable that Mr  Skelton was interviewed also by Mr Chowdhery.  He underwent psychometric testing.   The results were unexceptionable.  Mr Daniels found nothing to make him doubt the  trustworthiness of Skelton.  He was generally quiet and private.  In short, his  appointment to the post of Senior IT Auditor, with all the handling of personal data  and confidential information that might involve, was entirely appropriate.   85. As to his work, he would regularly be assigned audits which he had to undertake on  his own.  He was expected to operate with a significant degree of autonomy.  His  handling of the payroll data central to this case must also be seen in context: apart  from that data he regu larly had to handle information which colloquially would  be  termed sensitive or confidential.  In doing so, he never gave Morrisons cause before  2014 to doubt his trustworthiness.    86. As to the white powder incident, Mr Daniels recalled Skelton being somewha t  frustrated, a frustration he displayed as annoyance but “nothing greater”, and that he  had been irritated by the le vel of sanction he received.  Skelton  did not think that  legally posting a legal substance should have resulted in a formal sanction.  Afte r that  incident he did not display signs to Mr Daniels of being “overly aggrieved” but got on  with his job.  There was however a change in his apparent motivation.  As Mr Daniels  put it:  “he was a bit up and down and lacked drive and enthusiasm”.    87. In sum mary, in his witness statement, Mr Daniels told me that he thought Mr Skelton  had been upset by what had happened but not to the point where he could not be  trusted to do the job.  His pe rformance had become a bit lack lustre, and Mr Daniels  plainly thought  he might move on to a company other than Morrisons, but he was still  doing good work.  Mr Daniels saw what had happened as being a minor incident, in  respect of which Mr Skelton had received an appropriate sanction: he viewed the  formal verbal warning as a “rap across the knuckles”.   TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       88. Although the Claimants criticised the choice of Skelton as the recipient of the payroll  data for transmission to KPMG, no questions were asked of the witnesses as to the  identity of those who might have been alternative choic es.  Ultimately though, the  question for me is whether it was a breach of DPP7 to allocate the work to Skelton. I  assume in doing so that the other one or two internal IT auditors who reported to Mr  Daniels appeared competent and trustworthy  (since if they  did not they wo uld have   been excluded from the work) but no more so than Skelton appeared to be, at least  before the white powder incident. It is therefore only if there is something about the  events which  gave rise to the disciplinary proceedings or to S kelton’s apparent  reaction to them which casts doubt on either his competence or trustworthiness that it  can be said that Morrison should have chosen another to be part of the chain of  transfer to KPMG.    89. Mr Barnes relies heavily upon a finding at the disc iplinary hearing that Mr Skelton  had breached the mail room policy and failed to live up to “Morrisons’ values”.   He  submits that the censure was not triv ial:  it led to formal sanction and  the report  leading to the discipline suggested that Skelton’s act ions and behaviour viewed on  their own could amount to gross misconduct irrespective of the nature of the white  powder.  By failing to live up to “Morrisons’ Values”, Mr Barnes said that Morrisons  had stigmatised Skelton’s behaviour as irreconcilable with the manner in which the  Defendant wished to conduct its business.  He said this showed that he  had failed to  live up to the expectations of trust, integrity, teamwork, consideration for others, the  sharing of joint objectives and such like stated in the fu ller exposition of those Values  in the Employee Handbook.  The 6 month period during which the warning remained  effective indicated that a minimum period of rehabilitation was recognised as  necessary.  The fact that Skelton appealed showed he lacked insigh t into his  wrongdoing: rather than accept the sanction he chose to challenge the Defendant.   Nothing, or nothing much, was done to address his plain disenchantment afterwards.   The decision to entrust him with payroll data could not reflect an appropriate  approach to the security of that data.    90. In my view, these submissions overstate the significance of what happened.   Disciplinary codes such as those adopted by Morrisons in the present case are familiar  territory in employment practices.  Though Morrisons  was perhaps unusual amongst  employers in formalising a first verbal warning by recording it in writing (despite the  description “verbal”) this level represented the very least level of formal sanction. The  fact that an informal warning ranked lower does n ot mean that this warning was of  any great seriousness in the eyes of the employer. There was nothing about the  incident itself which suggested that Skelton could not be trusted.  Indeed, though Mr  Barnes s pent some time seeking to  establish the “Morrisons  value ” in play was “One  Team” , amplified by the explanation –  “We work together to reach a common goal .  It’s about keeping  our promises, building trust and respect, and valu ing each  other’s contributions”   Jo Goff, who decided the disciplinary appeal, did  not accept so far as she was  concerned that trust was involved.  Though “One Team” was certainly one of the  values, the value she had in mind when rejecting the appeal was that of “Great  Shopkeeping”, which involved the setting of high standards and takin g care of details,  and in any event the elements of “One Team” centred on working together.  In TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       essence, her view was that in an isolated incident Skelton did not pay sufficient care  and attention to the potential impact of his actions on fellow colleagues .    91. In my view, the reaction of Morrisons to what occurred in the white powder incident  and afterwards was appropriate.  The incident was a minor one, of thoughtlessness: it  did not demonstrate any intent to defraud, nor to prejudice colleagues, nor to hav e  Morrisons pay for postage to which he was not entitled in respect of his private  business.  Many employees have codes which provide for verbal warnings as to  particular aspects of their conduct.  It cannot sensibly be suggested that employees so  warned c annot then be trusted to do their job or require to be supervised.  If  supervised (the Claimant’s suggestion is “mentored”) that would almost inevitably be  seen by the employee as demeaning, and would in general give grounds for the  employee concerned to c laim he had been constructively dismissed.  There were no  grounds for dismissal.  There was no basis for supposing that the incident showed that  Skelton could not be trusted.  It did show that he was on one occasion thoughtless in  not anticipating what mig ht happen if those in the post room realised that there was an  unknown white powder being sent through their facilities, but no more.  I think it was  appropriate to regard it, as Mr Daniels did, as a rap across the knuckles.    92. To restrict Skelton’s handlin g confidential data as a result would have been to take an  action for which there was, at the time, no obvious logical basis, and if applied  consistently would have had to extend to restricting his dealings with other  confidential information which it was necessary for him to handle in the course of his  employment.  He was not just and only concerned with transmitting the payroll data.   In effect, as Ms Proops submits, if Morrisons had taken the approach suggested by the  Claimants it is difficult to see how  he could have done his job. Yet what he did in no  way merited dismissal.   The sanction imposed fell far short of that .  Morrisons could  not properly treat it as tantamount in effect to dismissal in Skelton’s case.   93.  I accept that there was nothing in his l ack of motivation to suggest that he had  decided criminally to disclose data entrusted to him, harming both his colleagues, to  whom the data principally related, and Morrisons, his employer.  If Morrisons were to  restrict Skelton’s access to confidential i nformation upon the basis of the white  powder incident their approach in doing so required to be replicated for others who  might be human links in a data transmission chain.  If a thoughtless action on one  occasion could give rise a real risk, which could be prevented only by dis allowing an  individual, who otherwise had not displayed thoughtlessness, access to data, a similar  approach would have to be taken in respect of any employee handling data who might  have been transiently thoughtless of others: this would include superusers, auditors,  senior managers and so forth.  It is not difficult to see that the degree of enquiry to  find out if employees had behaved in this way would be intrusive.  To institute  enquiries of such a nature would be disproportionate  to the risk posed.  When  considering whether Morrisons were in breach of DPP7 on the basis of the white  powder incident the balance falls decisively on the “appropriate” side of the line.   94. The evidence showed that the transfer of data from PeopleSoft to KP MG relied  critically upon trust being placed in individuals.  There was no failsafe system.  But  the Claimants do not suggest that there should have been. (For instance, I do not know  if a double key system, analogous to that used for security deposit boxe s in bank  vaults, could have been introduced under which data could be accessed on a work  laptop only if separate codes were input by each of two individuals who separately TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       held their own codes and whether if so it would have been viable or would have  minimised the risk: it was never suggested and never explored in evidence, and I  therefore discount it.)  Ultimately therefore the question as to permitting Skelton  access to the data comes down to whether it was inappropriate to trust him.  The only  reason no t to do so was the white powder incident, taken together with the hints of  disenchantment with work which followed.  For the reasons I have given however, the  incident itself did not suggest that Skelton was not to be trusted.  A lack of motivation  does no t equate to a positive criminal desire to harm the employer. Taking the two  together, the balance still falls on the appropriate side of the line.  In short, in  permitting Skelton to have the data Morrisons were not in breach of DPP7.    95. Since the incident,  procedures have changed a little. Had the revised procedures now  utilised been in operation in 2013, it would not have been necessary for an internal  auditor who was not a superuser to have handled the relevant payroll data.  However,  the system as revise d still critically depends upon the trustworthiness of human  agency.  DPP7 is directed towards systems.  The risk of human default remains,  despite the understandable concerns of Morrisons to guard against it as best they can.  The technological and organis ational measures current in 2013 and 2014 at their best  could not altogether prevent the risk posed by a rogue employee who was trusted and  had given no real reason to doubt his trustworthiness.   Monitoring and M entoring   96. Save in respect of deletion of the d ata, I can deal with the other control issues shortly.   No-one in employment at Morrisons knew, nor ought they have known , that Skelton  bore a grudge against the Defendant, and was not to be trusted with data.  Suggestion  that he should have been managed a nd mentored within the “rehabilitation period” of  6 months is unrealistic, and mischaracterises the 6 month life of the warning as a  “rehabilitation period”, as though the employee would have to prove himself within  that time.  The purpose of expiry after 6 months of a warning is simply that when  considering any issue of conduct later arising the employer would not be expected  after 6 months to take into account the circumstances giving rise to the former  warning.  The fact that within the 6 months they mig ht do so acts as a disincentive to  an employee to engage again in such conduct, and that represents the control  mechanism inherent in a standard disciplinary policy.   Beyond saying to Mr Skelton  that his conduct in posting a package containing white powde r was not acceptable,  and explaining why that was (a matter which on the evidence, I find Mr Daniels  thought Skelton appre ciated, even if Skelton  thought it did not merit the reaction of  Morrisons to it) it is difficult to see what Morrisons could be expec ted to do.  The “rap  across the knuckles” admin istered was , viewed  sensibly, all that was required.    E-mail Quarantine   97. The email sent by Leighto n to Skelton, attaching the pay roll data, “bounced back” and  was held in what could be called quarantine.  If t he system had been interrogated by a  senior manager, it could have been seen that this had happened.  If it had been, then  the Claimants suggested that this should have alerted the Defendants to the risk which  Skelton posed to the data.  This is unrealisti c.  The “bounce -back” involved no action  by Skelton himself.  There is nothing about it which would indicate that Skelton was  any more or less a risk than the risk implicit in the original decision (which I have  found not to be  inappropriate) to use Skelto n as a human conduit in transmission of TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       data from PeopleSoft to KPMG.  In truth, all it would have revealed to any observer  was that Leighton had attempted to send too large a quantity o f data by email to  Skelton .  That carries no implications for the subs equent security of the data,  especially in a case where, as here, there were encrypted USB sticks available to  transfer the data by another means.    Accessing the TOR N etwork   98. It was suggested in the claim that the Defendant should have been aware that Skel ton  was attempting to research the TOR network.    99. Mr Langley described that Morrisons have an external facing firewall which is  connected directly to the internet.  This is known as the “red side”.  A second firewall  protects Morrisons’ internal network (t he “green” side).  Between the two is what is  known as a “demilitarised zone” or “DMZ”, which can be accessed from the internet  but which has very limited access to Morrisons’ internal systems, which are protected  by the second firewall.  An intrusion dete ction system detects patterns of activity  which might indicate a potential attack from the red side.   Morrisons also operate a  Bluecoat server which is a proprietary web filtering proxy.  This both reduces the  volume of external internet traffic by storin g commonly accessed web pages, so that  when two or more members of staff request the same web page only one copy needs  to be obtained, and also restricts the sites which staff may access.  It captures all  requests for internet sites made by someone logged on to the internal Morrisons  network, and at the same time maintains a list of restricted websites by reference to  categories (e.g. pornographic material).  If a request is made for access to a restricted  site, the system effectively blocks that access.   100.  Morrisons maintain a huge list of restricted sites and update this regularly. One  restricted category is “proxy avoidance”.  This concerns access to those sites which  enable individuals to by -pass the restrictions imposed by Bluecoat by accessing the  internet by a website proxy.  The TOR network is one such proxy avoidance site, and  is listed on Bluecoat as such.  Accordingly, Mr Langley did not believe it would have  been possible for Skelton to access the TOR website itself from which to download  software needed to run the TOR network from his work laptop. Even if he were able  to do so by some other means Mr Langley’s evidence was that he would not have had  sufficient administrator access rights to enable him to install that software on his  laptop.  That wo uld have needed an administrator only password.  Only an authorised  IT administrator (which Skelton was not) could (and can) install such software on a  work laptop.    101. This evidence was not challenged in cross -examination.  I accept it.    102. As to whether Morr isons ought to have detected that he had researched or attempted  to research the TOR network using Morrisons systems, there was no system enabling  Morrisons automatically to detect when employees might be using the system to  research the TOR.  Nor do Morri sons have such a system in place today.    103. The Bluecoat server keeps a record of every website request made by the end user.   Thus, if an authorised person wishes to know what an individual employee has  attempted to look at on the internet at work, it is te chnically possible to get Bluecoat  to provide a list.  This is not done routinely, but only ever if there is an issue with a TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       particular employee such that the business feels it to be necessary and appropriate to  review that employee’s internet usage.   Nor would it be common practice in  organisations similar to Morrisons routinely to scrutinise employees’ web access  requests: Mr Langley said he had never in his career come across an organisation  which carried out on -going active monitoring of internet search es in order to flag up  search material which might be regarded as suspect.  In any event, it would be  necessary to identify what term was to be subject of the search.  To search for such as  “TOR” is hopelessly unspecific, for the sequence of 3 letters cons tituting the acronym  appears in a vast number of entirely innocuous longer words – examples were given  in his witness statement by Mr Langley of such as “history” or “factory” but it is  easily possible to think of many more, particularly since it often for ms the last 3  letters of a  noun – such as “navigator”, “actor”, “factor”.   104. I find that: -  i) active monitoring of internet searches by employees is not conducted at  Morrisons; and this is consistent with the practice adopted by other large  companies;   ii) it would  be impracticable to do this on a routine basis, in particular because it  would involve searching against individuals’ usage by reference to a number  of terms, and in respect of  “TOR” could have produced a plethora of results  which would be entirely innoc uous;   iii) even if the research had identified that Skelton had searched for information  about the TOR network, it would not in itself indicate his unsuitability to be a  recipient of payroll data for onward transmission: rather, as an internal IT  auditor it mig ht be thought to be a legitimate part of his role, or merely  curiosity;   iv) with 3,500 employees based at Hillmore House as was Skelton the resources  which would have to be expended to conduct routine active monitoring of the  type I have described would simply  be disproportionate, if indeed practicable  at all (which I conclude it would not have been);   v) in any event, for practical purposes any such arrangement was unnecessary  since the firewalls between them blocked undesirable material, and access to  dubious web sites was considerably restricted by an automatic filter in any  event;    vi) Finally, most companies – and I was told Morrisons was no exception – permit  employees to access the internet for personal reasons, within reason, and  provided this does not conflict with their duties.    105. Moreover, routine monitoring would almost undoubtedly be seen as invasive, and  would require a justification on an individual basis before it could properly be  conducted.  Indeed, in Barbulescu v Romania  (application 61496/08) [2017] E CHR  754, 5th September 2017) the  Grand Chamber of the European C ourt of Human Rights  considered the compatibility of intrusive surveillance conducted by an employer on  the electronic communications of an employee.  Over 8 days in July 2007 the  employer in that case recorded an employee’s Yahoo messenger communications in TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       real time, and on 13th July summoned him to explain the extent of his usage. When  the employee said that the usage was for work purposes he was shown a transcript of  45 pages of the message s which he had exchanged with his brother and his fiancée  during the period of monitoring.  They were all personal, and some were intimate.   When he told the employer in writing that he thought the employer had criminally  breached the secrecy of his corres pondence his contract of employment was  terminated.  The domestic courts upheld the dismissal.   106. The Grand Chamber decided that they had failed to determine whether the applicant  had received prior notice from his employer of the possibility that his commun ications  on Yahoo messenger might be monitored, had paid no regard to the fact that he had  not been informed of the nature or extent of that monitoring or of the degree of  intrusion into his private life and correspondence.  Nor were there specific reasons   justifying the introduction of the monitoring measures. The domestic courts should  have considered  whether the employer could have used measures which intruded less  into the employee’s private life and correspondence.  Accordingly, no fair balance had  been struck between article 8 of the Convention, which requires a state to pay respect  to private and family life, and the aims and methods of the employer.  This case is  thus high authority supporting a view that any attempt to institute surveillance of the   intensity suggested by the Claimants in the present case would be fraught with the risk  of being held unlawful.   107. In the present case, Morrisons had alerted employees through the Morrisons  Employee Handbook that it monitored the use of all systems and equip ment :   “to ensure our business is conducted appropriately, including: -   to establish facts where the content of the communication is disputed    to investigate and detect usage in breach of our policies    for training purposes    for preventing and detecting crime    to ensure the effective operation of our systems    we will not read all your correspondence, however if an anomaly of  concern is found we will investigate this thoroughly.”   Nonetheless, to introduce the type of monitoring which could have detected the  preci se nature of websites being accessed would be a step beyond the sort of  supervision indicated by that handbook.    108. Accordingly, even if the implementation of a system that could proactively have  detected that Skelton was researching the TOR network when he did was, contrary to  my findings, feasible, sensible and practicable, and even if, contrary to my findings,  the effort and expense involved in doing it would have been proportionate, it is likely  if introduced to have been difficult to justify since it wou ld most probably amount to  an unlawful interference with employees’ rights to privacy and family life, with little  by way of balancing factor to suggest otherwise.  TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       109. Finally, the particulars of claim refer to Skelton’s attempt to access the TOR network  as ha ving occurred subsequent to his involvement with the data transfer.  Since I am  of the view that he most probably copi ed the pay roll data to his personal USB on 18th  November 2013, it is unlikely that detecting that he had done so at a later stage could  have prevented the disclosure of that in 2014.  It might perhaps have deterred him  from effecting the disclosure, but I consider it more realistic to think that given the  careful planning that Skelton had devoted himself to even prior to receiving the data  (demonstrated by his searching for TOR on 9th. October , and purchasing a phone for  later use, coupled with copying data on to his personal USB on 18th. November, and   his devious conduct in using his skills in IT to throw blame onto another ), I conclude  that on balance, if there had, contrary to my findings, have been a failure to monitor  employees’ internet search usage it is unlikely that it would have prevented the data  disclosure which occurred.   The USB Stick   110. I have already concluded that the U SB stick us ed to convey the pay roll data to  Skelton was encrypted.  Irrespective of whether or not it was encrypted, once the  information it contained was copied to his computer it was inevitably accessible by  him (just as would have been the case had it come by secu re email): he could not  otherwise have transferred it from his computer to KPMG.  There was no breach of  DPP7 in using this means, nor did the use of it cause or contribute to the disclosure  which later occurred. It caused no relevant harm.   111. Though there wa s much cross -examination about Morrisons’ policies in respect of  data transfer (broadly, disallowing the general use of USB sticks) this was beside the  point when considering this specific case. If there was a breach of those policies, it  did not constitut e a relevant breach of DPP7; but in any event I find the use of the  USB in this case  was not in breach, since it was specifically understood that for  Michael Leighton’s purposes in transmitting a large quantity of data internally from  one secure site to an other an encrypted USB stick would be available  for him to use,  and he could permissibly use it .   Data Deletion   112. It is probable that Skelton deleted the data a short while after transfer to KPMG, and  did so at the conclusion of what would have been a reason able period of time in which  to anticipate requests for further information generated by the audit process KPMG  were undertaking (say, until mid -December).  Since it is probable that the payroll data  was copied to Skelton’s personal USB stick on 18th Novem ber 2013, and it is to be  inferred that this was with a view to the later commission of the crime consisting of  disclosure of the data, he would have had no reason to retain the data for longer in any  event. It is likely he did delete the data, if only to give the appearance to anyone who  looked that it had been removed.    113. I do not consider that Mr Daniels, or any member of Morrisons management, could  properly be criticised for not asking Skelton before mid December that the data had  been deleted, or checki ng that it had been.  This is because it would have been  appreciated that there was a need to keep a copy of the information on Skelton’s work  laptop and, indeed, as I have already accepted, this was preferable to the alternative  (of dipping in and out of the Peoplesoft system) because that would have involved TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       some risk, albeit small, in the additional transmission of data which that would have  necessitated.  It therefore follows, too, that there was no breach of the data protection  principle of DPP7 if the re were indeed a failure to ask or check prior to mid  December 2013.  Accordingly, since the data had by then probably already been  copied the request  for evidence of deletion , whether made or not after that time,  would have been ineffective to prevent Ske lton’s subsequent criminal misuse of the  data.   114. I consider it likely that Skelton did delete the payroll data from his work laptop.  It is  known that at some time he removed the data leaving just the template into which that  data had been inserted: in March  2014 he showed that empty template (albeit with the  headings still complete) to Daniels when he then checked.   115. As to whether Daniels checked prior to that the evidence is mixed.  In his witness  statement Daniels said:   “60. It would not have been necessary for Mr Skelton to retain  the payroll data for long after it had been passed to KPMG.  He  might retain it for a relatively short while in case any queries  arose, for example, completeness of the data.  After that, I  would have expected him to delete it, and  in his capacity as an  IT internal auditor, he would know professionally that it should  be deleted.  Senior auditors are expected to manage data  responsibly.    61.  In fact, I recall discussing with Mr Skelton the retention of  the file structure and headin gs and the deletion of the contents  and, later on, asked if he had deleted it and he confirmed to me  that he had.  My best recollection is that I asked Mr Skelton if  the data had been deleted relatively shortly after it had been  provided to KPMG because in  the normal course and working  closely with Mr Skelton that is a conversation he and I would  naturally have.  I would normally ask this where any sensitive  data has been provided to my team and not merely payroll data.   I would not have asked to see Mr Ske lton’s computer to verify  this fact, although later on (I do not recall when) I did see the  headings that had been left after the data had been deleted from  the spreadsheet.  I would not, though, usually ask whether a  member of my team had deleted data bec ause I would trust  them to do it.”   116. This passage is muddled.  It appears to suggest that he actually remembered having a  conversation, then goes on to say only that it is one which he “would naturally have  had”.  It ends with the statement that he would not  usually ask whether a member of  his team had deleted data, having just said that asking Mr Skelton was a conversation  that he would naturally have had.  When taxed  with this in the course of his evidence,  it became clear to me that he had no actual memory  of having spoken to Skelton prior  to the news of the disclosure of data coming to light.  I find that he was struggling to  recollect what he actually did, and that his usual practice was not so entrenched as a  matter of course that I can be satisfied that  he did in fact ask before March 2014.   Indeed, as the last sentence of paragraph 61 of his witness statement suggests he did TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       not generally see the need to ask since he operated on trust.  He did have a  recollection of seeing the file structure and heading s with the data deleted: this, in my  view, was most probably around the time that enquiries were being made as to the  source of the data leak which had occurred – hence my conclusion that it was most  probably March 2014.    117. It follows from this that I find there was no organised system for the deletion of data  such as the payroll data stored for a brief while on Skelton’s computer.  There was no  failsafe system in respect of it.  To this extent, in my view, Morrisons fell short of the  requirements of DPP7: w here data is held outside the usual secure repository used for  it (in the case of the payroll data, within the Peoplesoft system) there is an  unnecessary risk of proliferation and of inadvertent disclosure (let alone deliberate  action by an employee) revea ling some of that data.  Morrisons took this risk, and did  not need to do so. Organisational measures which would h ave been neither too  difficult  n or too onerous to implement could have been adopted to minimise it.   118. I had the strong sense that within Morri sons’ head office systems as they operated in  2013 it would have been regarded as indicating a lack of trust in an employee if a  manager were specifically to check that he had performed a process such as deletion.   It is right that such checking could in s ome circumstances be capable of justifying an  employee in thinking that his employer lacked the trust in him which was requisite for  their employment relationship to continue.  However, this does not apply where there  is a clear understanding amongst emplo yees, created by management, that it is  expected of their managers that they will check to see that files have been deleted, at  least where the  information they may contain is  of sufficient sensi tivity.  If a culture is  developed in which employees expect that as a matter of routine managers will check  to see that there has been deletion of data, which has been held outside its usual  secure repository, by those with whom it has for the time being been deposited, no  employee could be justified in thinking th at checking the deletion displayed any lack  of trust: it would merely be the employer instituting, maintaining and operating safe  and proper systems of checking as normal.    119. I note Mr Langley’s view that it was neither realistic nor proportionate to impose  an  obligation to the effect that managers had to oversee directly and immediately the  deletion of data by senior trusted employees, all the more so where the employees’  role essentially consisted of the routine processing of significant quantities of  sensitive data.  However, I do not agree that it w ould be onerous to institute a system  of checking, to be expected within a changed culture such as I have described.    120. I do accept, however, that the risk which primarily would be mitigated by such a  system wou ld be that of inadvertent retention of information, and that this on its own  could not have prevented an individual determined to do so from copying sensitive  data held on his work laptop to some other medium.  In the particular circumstances  of this case,  by the time it would have been appropriate to conduct any such check on  deletion, the probability is that the information had already been copied. Thus,  notwithstanding that I consider Morrisons in this respect to have failed to discharge  their duty to ta ke appropriate organisational measures to guard against unlawful  disclosure and/or data loss, to the extent that Morrisons fell short of DPP7 in this  respect , this failure neither caused nor contributed to the disclosure which occurred.   TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       Burden of Proof   121. Morrisons maintain that it is for the Claimant to prove breach of any of the Data  Protection Principles which they suggest may have been broken, and that the event in  respect of which they claim was caused by that breach.  The Claimants maintain that  the bu rden is on the Defendant to prove that its arrangements were appropriate.   Interesting though this debate is, it is not necessary for me to resolve it in this case.  I  have had sufficient evidence,  to find relevant facts, and to draw conclusions as to the  probabilities. I have not had to depend upon the burden of proof.  I have not had to  resolve any of the issues by reference to it, but rather I have been able to make  positive findings in all material respects.    The Inadequate Controls Claim: Conclusions   122. In summary, for the reasons I have given I find that Morrisons did not know nor ought  they reasonably to have known that Skelton posed a threat to the employee database;  that, save in one respect, there were no control mechanisms which the Defendant  ought to have applied in respect of Skelton which were not appropriately applied; that  one respect was in relation to the deletion of data but in that case, if appropriate  measures had been applied, any reasonable measure that might have been  implemented of whic h I had any evidence or submission would not have prevented  Skelton’s criminal misuse of the employee data.    Primary Liability a t Common Law  and Equity   123. Morrisons did not directly misuse any information personal to the data subjects. Nor  did they authorise  its misuse, nor permit it by any carelessness on their part. If  Morrisons are liable it must be vicariously or not at all.   124. It was not in contention that of the elements necessary for a breach of confidence  action to succeed, there was information given to  Morrisons, and that it was  confidential. It was disclosed.  However, it was not disclosed by Morrisons either  directly or by an agent.  In such circumstances, no primary liability  attaches to  Morrisons for this disclosure. It was a criminal act which was not Morrisons ’ doing,  which was not facilitated by Morrisons, nor authorised by it.  It was contrary to what  Morrisons would have wished. If Morrisons are liable it must be vicariously or not at  all.   125. It follows that there is no primary liability resting o n Morrisons under any of the  DPA, the common law of misuse of private information, or  an equitable action for  breach of confidence.  There remains the question whether Morrisons are liable as a  secondary party for any of the wrongs of which Skelton himself  was undoubtedly  guilty.     Vicarious Liability   126. Auld LJ  in Majrowski v Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust  [2005] EWCA Civ 251,  [2005] QB  848 said (at paragraphs 28 -29):   TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       “…vicarious liability is legal responsibility imposed on an  employer, although he is himse lf free from blame for a tort  committed by his employee in the course of his employment.   Fleming, in The Law of Torts 9th ed. (1998), pp 409 -410,  observed that this formula represents:   “A compromise between tw o conflicting policies: on one  hand, the socia l interest in furnishing an innocent tort victim  with recourse against a financially responsible defendant; on  the other, a hesitation to foist any undue burden on a  business enterprise”.   Second, it has traditionally been regarded as taking two forms:  first liability for  an authorised or negligently permitted  unlawful act of an employee in the course  of employment; and,  second, liability for an employee’s unauthorised or not  negligently permitted unlawful mode of doing an authorised act  in the course of emp loyment.  Only the latter is truly vicarious  liability; the former is primary liability.”   127. Although his judgment was appealed to the House of Lords (where it was affirmed)  those passages do not appear to have been contentious.    128. I am concerned here with tha t which Auld LJ called “truly vicarious liability”.  The  liability is one in which one party without personal fault is held responsible in law for  wrongs committed by another.  The most common relationship between the person at  fault, and the person who, t hough not at fault is also to be held liable in law  in  addition to the party at fault, is that of employment, as it is here.    129. The origins of vicarious liability may be unclear: perhaps lying in the rapid growth in  the number  of employees,  and size s of wor kforce of enterprises during and after the  industrial revolution, and perhaps lying originally in an extension of agency  principles. It is unnecessary to say more since the possibilities and history are  comprehensively set out in the judgment of Lord Touls on JSC in Mohamud v  William Morrison Supermarkets plc  [2016] UKSC11 at paragraphs 10 – 24.   130. Recent cases have concerned one of two main matters.  First is that of  the  relationships which might render one party to them responsible in law for the wrongs  of the other party, since a restriction to those relationships being employment or  agency might in some cases be unjust . A notable example is that of Armes v  Nottinghamshire County Council  [2017] UKSC 60  where the judgment of the  Supreme Court as to whether a Council might be liable for wrongs done by a foster - parent to whom it had entrusted the care of a child was reported during the closing  stages of the hearing before me. This is not, however, a case in which there can be any  doubt that the relationship betw een Morrisons and Skelton was such that vicarious  liability might apply. By the end of the 19th century, it had been recognised that an  employer might be liable for a wrongful act done by a servant in the course of his  employment.  The second main consider ation in recent caselaw has been the proper  approach to “the course of employment”. Given that Skelton was an employee of  Morrisons at the material time, it is this to which I now turn.  TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       131. The precise scope of “course of employment” which could bring secondar y liability  upon an employer for a wrongful act was defined by Salmond in the first (1907)  edition of his text book on the law of torts, Salmond on Torts , as “either (a) a  wrongful act authorised by the master or (b) an unauthorised mode of doing some act  authorised by the master” adding that a master was liable for acts which he had not  authorised if they were “so connected with the acts which he has authorised that they  may rightly be regarded as modes – although improper modes – of doing them” (pp  83-84).  As Lord Toulson noted in Mohamud  (paragraph 26) there might be  difficulties in the application of this formula in cases of injury to persons or property  caused by an employee’s deliberate act of misconduct.  In Bazley v Curry   (1999)  174 DLR  (4th) 45, in considering the question whether, and to what extent, an  employer might be liable for an employee’s criminal conduct, contrary to the desires  and policies of the employer, MacLachlan CJ saw liability as arising out of twin  principles, first that it was j ust that an enterprise which created risk by its operations  should pay if those risks materialised (“enterprise risk”), and second that it was a  matter of policy to encourage the employer to exercise the power of control inherent  in and essential to a cont ract of employment so as to minimise any potential harm so  arising (“deterrence”).  These principles were better served by taking a broad  approach to the scope and meaning in this context of “course of employment”, and  were a significant factor in persuadi ng the House of Lords in Lister v Hesley Hall  Ltd [2002] A.C. 215, HL that the test of “sufficiently close connection with the  employment” should take those two policy considerations into account, effecting a  “compromise between two conflicting policies: o n the one hand the social interest in  furnishing an innocent tort victim with recourse against a financially responsible  defendant ; on the other a hesitation to f oist any undue burden on a business  enterprise.”    132. There are differences of policy emphasis in  the speeches in Lister .  Lord Clyde’s  approach (paragraphs 37 -42) was to gauge the sufficiency of the connection by asking  whether the wrongful acts, in a broad sense, should be regarded as within the sphere  or scope of the employment so as to be ways of carrying out the work authorised by  the employer; Lord Millett’s approach was broader still.  He regarded vicarious  liability as a species of strict liability, best understood as a “loss distribution device.”   This echoed the policy concept that he who has  the deeper pockets should suffer the  impact of a loss where it might fall on more than one party.  Lord Hobhouse of  Woodborough however focussed on the notion of delegation or entrustment, namely  that an employer was vicariously liable for the wrongful ac t of its employee where it  had “entrusted” a duty to an employee who, by his wrongful act, had failed to perform  it.    133. Lister  represented something of a watersh ed moment in the recent develop ment of  vicarious liability so far as concerns liability for the criminal actions of employees  contrary to the wishes of their employer. Lord Toulson recognised in Mohamud  (at  para. 40) that the concept of “enterprise risk” has been prominent in cases since  Lister  as the social underpinning of the doctrine of vicarious liability, but added:   “…the court is not required in each case to conduct a  retrospective assessment of the degree to which the employee  would have been considered to present a risk.  As Immanuel  Kant wrote: “out of the crooked timber of humanity, no stra ight TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       thing was ever made.”  The risk of an employee abusing his  position is one of life’s unavoidable facts.”   “In Dubai Al uminium Co. Ltd. v Salaam  [2003] 2AC 366,  Lord Nichols of Birkenhead (with whom Lords Slynn and  Hutton agreed) said (at paragraph 22) “…it is a fact of life, and  therefore to be expected by those who carry on businesses, that  sometimes their agents may exceed the bounds of their  authority or even defy express instructions.  It is fair to allocate  risk of losses thus arising to the busine sses rather than leave  those wronged with a sole remedy, of doubtful value, against  the individual employee who committed the wrong.  To this  end, the law has given the concept of “ordinary course of  employment” an extended scope.    23.   If, then, authori ty is not the touchstone, what is?...   Perhaps the best general answer is that the wrongful conduct  must be so closely connected with acts … the employee was  authorised to do that, for the purpose of the liability of the firm  or the employer of third parti es, the wrongful conduct may  fairly and properly  be regarded as done by the partner while  acting in the ordinary course of the firm’s business or the  employee’s employment… (original emphasis)         ………..   25.  This “close connection” test focuses attention  in the right  direction.  But it affords no guidance on the type or degree of  connection which would normally be regarded as sufficiently  close to prompt the legal conclusion that the risk of the  wrongful act occurring, and any loss flowing from the wrongf ul  act, should fall on the firm or employer rather than the third  party who was wronged…   26.  This lack of precision is inevitable given the infinite range  of circumstances where the issue arises.  The crucial feature or  features, either producing or negat ing vicarious liability, vary  widely from one case or type of case to the next.  Essentially  the court makes an evaluative judgment in each case, having  regard to all the circumstances and, importantly, having regard  also to the assistance provided by prev ious court decisions.”   134. Lord Toulson’s judgment continues with an observation that the test of “close  connection” might tell nothing abou t the nature of that connection, but that in Lister   the court had been mindful of a risk of over -concentrating on a part icular form of  terminology, and there was a risk in attempting to over refine or lay down a list of  criteria for determining what precisely amounted to a sufficiently close connection to  make it just for the employer to be held vicariously liable.  He said  “simplification of  the essence is more desirable”.  As to that he said, under the heading “The Present  Law”, as follows: - TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       “44.  In the simplest terms, the court has to consider all matters.   The first question is what functions or “field of activities” ha ve  been entrusted by the employer to the employee, or, in  everyday language, what was the nature of his job.  As has been  emphasised in several cases, this question must be addressed  broadly…”   45… Secondly, the court must decide whether there was  sufficien t connection between the position in which he was  employed and his wrongful conduct to make it right for the  employer to be held liable under the principle of social justice  which goes back to Holt CJ.  To try to measure the closeness of  connection, as it were, on a scale of 1 – 10, would be a forlorn  exercise and, what is more, it would miss the point.  The cases  in which the necessary connection has been found for Holt CJ’s  principle to be applied are cases in which the employee used or  misused the positi on entrusted to him in a way which injured  the third party.  Lloyd v Grace Smith and Co . [1912] AC716,  Pettersson v Royal Oak Hotel Ltd  [1948] NZLR 136 and  Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd  were all cases in which the employee  misused his position in a way which in jured the claimant, and  that is the reason why it was just that the employer who  selected him and put him in that position should be held  responsible.  By contrast, in Warren v Henlys Ltd  [1948] 2  All ER  935 any misbehaviour by the petrol pump attendant,  qua petrol pump attendant, was past history by the time that he  assaulted the claimant…”   135. Mohamud  was a case in which the Claimant, having stopped at a petrol station at one  of Morrisons Supermarkets, went into the sales kiosk and asked the Defendant’s  emplo yee serving there if it would be possible to print off some documents which the  Claimant had stored on a USB stick.  The employee refused the request in an  offensive manner, and in the exchange of words which followed he used racist,  abusive and violent la nguage towards the Claimant and ordered him to leave.  He then  followed the Claimant as he walked back to his car and, having told him never to  return, subjected him to a serious physical attack.  In an action by the Claimant for  damages against Morrisons on the grounds that it was vicariously liable for the assault  the judge at first instance found that the employee had indeed assaulted the Claimant,  but dismissed the claim against Morrisons since the employee’s actions had been  purely for reasons of his o wn and beyond the scope of his employment such that there  was an insufficiently close connection between the two.  The Court of Appeal  dismissed the appeal. The Supreme Court allowed it.  Applying the principles which  he had set out (summarised above) Lord  Toulson regarded the employee’s job as  being to attend to customers and to respond to their enquiries, such that the offensive  way in which he answered the Claimant’s request and ordered him to leave, though  inexcusable, was within the field of activities  assigned to him, and what happened  afterwards was an unbroken sequence of events. Although what he did was a gross  abuse of his position, it was in connection with the business in which he was  employed to serve customers, a position which his employers ha d entrusted to him,  making it just that as between them and the Claimant they should be held responsible TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       for the employee’s abuse of it.  He thought the employee’s motive was irrelevant: “it  looks obvious that he was motivated by personal racism rather tha n a desire to benefit  his employer’s business, but that is neither here nor there.”    136. The other members of the court all agreed with Lord Toulson JSC; Lord Dyson added  a short judgment of his own emphasising that the second limb of the Salmond  test  was not  effective for determining the circumstances in which it was just to hold an  employer vicario usly liable for committing an a ct not authorised by the employer.  A  close connection test remedied the short coming and incorporated the concept of  justice into th e close connection test.  He thought however, that it was difficult to see  how that test might be further refined.    137. I ado pt the approach as set out in Mohamud .  Since that case was decided the  approach has been applied on a number of occasions.  I was ref erred in particular to  Bellman v Northampton Recruitment Ltd  [2016] EWHC 3104, QB; [2017] ICR  543.  After a Ch ristmas Party organised by the D efendant about half of those who had  been present adjourned to a local hotel, where they sat talking in the hotel lobby,  consuming more alcohol.  Early in the morning of the next day conversation turned to  work.  The managing director, who was in overall charge of the company, became  annoyed by the discussion and at about 3am assaulted the Claimant employee.  The  Claimant sought damages against the Defendant company for the actions of its  employee, the manager.  His claim was dismissed because the judge concluded that,  in applying the two stage test, while consideration of the time and place in which the  relevant act o ccurred would always be relevant there had to  be some greater  connection than  the mere opportunity to commit the act offered by the chance of place  and time; the assault had been committed after, and not during, an organised work  social event; there was no t only a temporal but a substantive difference between the  Christmas party and the discussion over drinks at the hotel; and the fact that the  discussion had turned to work did not turn what was a recreational activity into  something which was to be viewed as the course of employment such that there would  be a sufficient connection to make it right to hold the company liable.    138. In Various Claimants v Barclays Bank plc  [2017] E WHC  1929 (QB) 126 the  Claimants sought damages against Barclays Bank in respect of sexual assaults to  which they alleged they were subjected by a doctor examining them for the purposes  of employment  by the Bank.     139. Each claimant was required to attend the home of a doctor engaged by the Bank,  where he had a consulting room.  I t was said t hat in the course of his examination on  behalf of the bank he sexually assaulted them.  Of the two stage test applicable when  considering if the wrongful acts of the doctor had been committed in the course of his  employment by the Bank, the princip al thrus t of the judgment was concerned whether  the doctor had a sufficient relationship with the bank fo r it to be liable for his  wrong doing.  Nicola Davies J held that he was an employee.  As to the second  stage –  close connection - she held what he did to be sufficiently closely connected with his  employment:   “46. The alleged sexual assault occurred during the course of a  medical examination which the defendant required the  claimants to undergo in respect of present and future  employment.  The task of carrying out the medical examination TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       was entrusted to Dr. Bates by the defendant.  The task assigned  to Dr. Bates put him in a position to deal with the claimants.   On the alleged facts he abused that position.  It is difficult to  see how it can sensibly be argued that his acts did not fall  within the activity tasked to him… on the facts I find that  alleged sexual abuse  was inextricably interwoven with the  carrying out by the doctor of his duties pursuant to his  engagement by the bank.  In the circumstances I find  the tort is  so closely connected with that employment or engagement to  satisfy the second stage. ”    Two Preliminary Points on Vicarious Liability   140. Before turning to the application of these common law principles, as set out in  Mohamud  and illustrated by the decisions in Bellman  and VC v Barclays Bank   there are two preliminary matters with which I have to deal, raised by Ms Pr oops QC.   The first is whether the Data Protection Act  by its terms excludes any possibility of  vicarious liability.  Her argument centr es on DPP7.  She submits first that  the DPA  does not recognise any form of vicarious liability for the  unauthorised acts of  employees, and DPP7 confirms this.   Second, she submits that the DPA is such that  only data controllers are subject to civil obligat ions and consequent liability under the  Act: neither attaches to any person processing data qua employee or agent of the data  controller.  In her opening written case, she argued that there was accordingly no  statutory civil liability which attaches to a p erson processing data qua employee and  accordingly no civil liability for which a data controller can be held vicariously liable.    141. In my view, this submission in  her opening misunderstands the nature of vicarious  liability.  A party may be held liable vic ariously even for a breach of a S tatute for  which that party  could not itself be held liable.  Th us where, under the statutory  provisions relating to shot firing in mines  a duty was placed on the shot firer (but not  upon the mine owner or manager), the min e owner or manager might nonetheless be  held liable even though neither it nor he could have committed the tort in question.    Lord McDermott in Harrison v National Coal Board  [1951] AC  639, at 671 dealt  with the point in a passage which, while strictly obi ter, was fully considered.    “[Counsel for the Coal  Board] advanced a further alternative  argument  to the effect that, the duty in question having been  placed on Spence [the shot firer] exclusively, the Respondents  could not be made responsible for his bre ach thereof even if the  doctrine of common employment did not apply.  In other  words, the maxim respondeat superior had no applicability in  the case of a statutory duty so laid on a servant .   My Lords on  the views already expressed it is not strictly nece ssary to deal  with this submission.  but it was debated at sufficient length at  the Bar to lead me to think that to reserve it for consideration at  some future occasion might give it more encouragement than it  deserves.  It comes to saying that ( apart, of c ourse , from the  doctrine of common employment) a master is not vicariously  liable in respect of his servant’s statutory negligence.  To my TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       mind this, as a general proposition, finds no support in principle  or authority.  Vicarious liability is not confined  to common law  negligence.  It arises from the servant’s tortious acts in the  scope of his employment and there can now be no doubt that  Spence in breaking the shot firing regulations committed a  tort.”  142. This approach was clearly endorsed in Majrowski  in th e speech of Lord Nichols of  Birkenhead paragraphs 10 – 17.  In summary, at paragrap h 17 he concluded: “unless  the S tatute expressly or impliedly indicates otherwise, the principle of vicarious  liability is applicable where an employee commits a breach of h is statutory  obligations sounding in damages while acting in the course of his employment. ”  In  the same case, Lord Hope (paragraph 42) noted that Counsel for the employer  accepted that he could not succeed in an appeal against the decision of the Court of   Appeal below that in general an employer may be vicariously liable for a breach of  statutory duty imposed on an employee which is committed in the course of his  employment, and that an employer may be vicariously liable for a breach of statutory  duty impo sed only upon the employee. Accordingly, I reject the submission that – if  indeed it can be said that direct liability for his acts as data controller in respect of the  relevant information was cast by S tatute on Skelton alone – this has the consequence  that vicarious liability for his breach of the relevant statutory duty was excluded.   143. Further, i n Majrowski  a submission by Counsel for the employer that there was no  presumption either in favour or against the proposition  that a statute encompassed  vicarious  liability  was rejected : the House held that vicarious l iability will apply  unless the S tatute providing for liability expressly or impliedly indicates otherwise.    144. Majrowski  itself concerned vicarious liability for an act of harassment (incidentally,  necessarily a criminal act under the S tatute , since the same acts could either be  prosecuted or be the subject of a civil suit ) allegedly committed by a co -employee  against the Claimant. The Act covered the UK as a whole.  In respect of applicability  of the Ac t in Scotland , the S tatute  expressly referred to the Defend er as being the  person responsible for the alleged harassment “…or the employer or principal of such  person”.  Had it not been for that provision four of their Lordships expressed the view  that the  decision would have been finely balanced as to whether the Act, interpreted  as a whole but absent that provision, impliedly excluded an employer being held  vicariously liable for an act of harassment committed by an employee .  Though they  expressed some u ncertainty one, Lord Nicholl s, appeared clear that it would certainly  not have excluded this .    145. Central to the judgments was a sense that the Prevention from Harassment Act  1997 , with which  the case of  Majrowski  was concerned , was designed principally to  prevent harassment and protect victims from it; and it had an intense focus on the  perpetrator in getting him to stop (see per Baroness Hale at paragraph 68).  There  were “…indeed powerful reasons for thinking that Parliament intended liability and  damages should be personal to the perpetrator of the harassment and that it should not  be extended to his employer, if any, under the doctrine of vicarious liability…”.   146. Undeterred, Ms Proops argues that Majrowski  has no realm of application in the  present case bec ause that decision  was not concerned with legislation that plainly does  not fix employees (as opposed to data controllers) with any civil liability whatsoever; TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       the DPA is not concerned with the actions of servants acting in the course of their  employment, but rather with the actions of autonomous, self -determining data  controllers.  The fact that the DPA does not attach liability to a person acting as an  employee, as opposed to acting in a distinct, private capacity as an autonomous self - directing data cont roller, means that there is no statutory wrong committed by the  employee on which the principle of vicarious liability could even arguably bi te.  The  scheme is preoccupied exclusively with the direct, not secondary, liability of data  controllers.  The appr oach to liability of a data controller under the DPA is fault  based, which leaves no room for the implication of no fault vicarious liability on a  data controller : she notes that  paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 to the DPA provides that  the data controller must take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of any  employees who h ave access to the personal data, not to act as their insurer.   Ms  Proops submits that under section 13(3) of the DPA a data controller will have a  defence if it can show that it took rea sonable care to comply with the relevant  requirement – in the case of an unreliable employee, that it took reasonable care to  ensure that employee’s reliability.  That provision provides the be all and end all of  the responsibility of Morrisons for the def aults of any employee.  To permit vicarious  liability to run wou ld render that requirement otio se: employers would have little  incentive to comply with it if they were nonetheless to be held liable for the actions of  their unreliable employees even where t hey had done their best to ensure that they  were reliable.  It is a nonsense to suggest that Morrisons, having fulfilled their own  obligations qua data controller, can at one and the same time be held vicariously liable  for the actions of another third par ty data controller, who by definition is acting as an  autonomous, self -directing controller in respect of the relevant data.  There are many  good policy reasons why Parliament should have drawn the line as it did.  Many, if  not most, enterprises would have  to process significant quantities of data.  It is in the  public interest that they should do so.  It is very difficult to safeguard the data which  such an enterprise processes against employee misuse , as the facts of the present case  amply demonstrate.  T he ease with which employees are legitimately given access to  such data gives rise to a risk of copying, extracting or otherwise misusing that data  which it is very difficult if not impossible to control.    If data controllers are to be  held vicariously l iable for the actions of their employees, in the absence of any  culpable default on their part, that would potentially expose them , unjustly,  to  enormously burdensome group litigation and claims out of all proportion to the value  of the claims of the indiv idual data subjects concerned.  Liability on such a scale is  disproportion ate, yet the legislation itself derives from a European Directive, in  respect of the interpretation and application of which proportionality is a key concept.   Parliament would have seen that imposing liability for the criminal actions of an  individual employee could have a chilling effect on data processing operations across  the board.  It might introduce a culture of suspicion and indeed paranoia in the work  place, for employers mig ht prefer to err on the side of dismissal of disgruntled  employees or of subjecting them to draconian invasive surveillance in the hope that  that might help to insulate the employer from liability.  There is a real risk that the  financial viability of some  enterprises might be compromised.    147. Before expressing my conclusions on these points, I shall set out t he argument on the  second point preliminary to considering whether Skelton’s actions were sufficiently  closely connected to his discharge of the  functio ns assigned to him . This  is the  submission by Ms Proops that the DPA was intended by Parliament to occupy the  entirety of the field of liability for data as defined in the Act, leaving no space within TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       which any, or any further , actions for misuse of inform ation or breach of confidence   could operate .  She submits that it  is not constitutionally permissible for the courts to  enter the field and conclude that Parliament has not gone far enough, or that its  legislative work is incomplete, such that further liab ility should be imposed as  common law.  Vicarious liability at common law or in equity thus cannot go beyond  the liability imposed by Pa rliament under the DPA which is, in accordance with the  first preliminary point (should it be answered in Morrisons’ fav our), to the effect that  liability rests upon Morrisons while acting as data controller alone and excludes  liability for an employee separately in breach of his own obligations under that Act.   If Ms Proops succeeds on this submission, vicarious liability arises only in respect of  the DPA if at all: if it fails, then vicarious liability potentially arises in respect of each  and all of the  causes of action , subject to the disclosure having been in the course of  Skelton’s employment  by Morrisons.   148. In support of this submission, she referred to  McKerr  [2004] UKHL 12; [2004] 1   WLR  807 in which the question arose whether the courts could impose a common law  obligation on the State corresponding to that in Article 2 of the European Convention  on Human Rights in an  area which had been regulated by legislation.  The argument  advanced to the House of Lords on behalf of Mr McKerr (whose father had been  killed by the use of force by the Royal Ulster Constabulary) was that the Secretary of  State was , or should be , subjec t to a common law obligation to arrange for an  effective investigation into his father’s death .  As to that, Lord Nicholls said  at  paragraph 32 :-  “The effect of Counsel’s submission would be that the co urt  would create an overriding common law obligation o n the state,  corresponding to article 2 of the Convention, in an area of the  law for which Parliament has long legislated.  The courts have  always been slow to develop law by entering, or re -entering, a  field regulated by legislation.  Rightly so , because otherwise  there would inevitably be the prospect of the common law  shaping powers and duties and provisions inconsistent with  those prescribed by Parliament….   33…… The suggested new common law right is sought as a  means of supplementing, or overriding, the  statutory provisions  relating to the holding of coroners’ inquests.  That is not an  appropriate role for the common law.    34. This view is confirmed by another feature of the case.  As  already emphasised, by enacting the 1998 Act Parliament  created domes tic law rights corresponding to rights arising  under the Convention.  When doing so Parliament chose not to  give the legislation retroactive effect.  In relation to article 2 the  intention of Parliament, as interpreted above, was not to create  an investiga tive right in respect of deaths occurring before the  Act came into force.  The common law right urged on behalf or  Mr McKerr would accord ill with this legislative intention.  The  effect of the propounded right would be to impose positive  human rights obli gations on the state as a matter of domestic TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       law in advance of the date on which a corresponding positive  obligation arose under the 1998 Act. ”      149. Similarly in Rottman v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis  [2002] UKHL  20, 2002 2  AC 692, the question b efore the House of Lords was whether at common  law a police officer executing a warrant of arrest issued pursuant to Section 8 of the  Extradition Act 1989  had power to search for and seize any goods or documents  which he reasonably believed to be material evidence in relation to the extradition  crime in respect of which the warrant was issued.  On analysis of the legislation, the  House of Lords concluded that there was nothing in it that operated to prevent the  continued operation of common law doctrine whi ch had pre -existed  the Act .  Lord  Hoffman said (paragraph 75) “it is a well established principle that a rule of common  law is not extinguished by a statute unless the statute makes this clear by express  provision or by clear implication.”  Th ough the  Admi nistrative Court, from which the  certified question had come, had held that the Police and Criminal Evidence Act   (“PACE”) had extinguished the common law power to search the Respondent’s house  five years before  the Extradition Act was passed, h e could not see any saving  provision in it for the common law power.  However, t he true question was not  whether PACE had saved the common law power, but whether it had extinguished or  abolished it.  Only one provision in the S tatute could have had that effect – Sectio n  17(5) , which provid ed that all the rules of common law under which a constable had  power to enter premises without a warrant were thereby abolished.  As to that , Lord  Roger identified the very particular context within which Section 17(5) operated and  commented, at paragraph 109:     “Since Section 17(5) occurs within this very particular context,  it is plain that it was intended to abolish only the common law  powers relating to entry for the purpose of arrest.  The sub - section was not intended to affect t he common law relating to  searches for evidence carried out when someone has been  arrested.”   150. Accordingly, since no provision of PACE  abolished the common law powers of  search and seizure  on or after arrest, they continued to operate, and the search with  which the House of Lords was concerned was held accordingly to be lawful.    151. In effect, Ms Proops contrasted  the position in Rottman  with that in McKerr : in  Rottman  the Act had not had the effect of legislating in the field which common law  had previously cov ered.   152. In R (Child Poverty Action Group) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions   [2010] UKSC  54; [2011 ] 2 AC 15 the question was whether the Department for Work  and P ensions could rely on the common law remedy of restitution to reclaim social  security be nefits paid in error.  Section 71 of the 1992 Social Security  Administration Ac t made provision  for the Secretary of State to recover  overpayments made where there had been misrepresentation or failure to disclose  from the person who misrepresented the fac t or failed to disclose it.  The House  agreed that Section 71 was intended to be an exhaustive code.   In the speech of Lord  Dyson JSC he said:  TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       “33.  If the two remedies cover the precisely the same ground  and are inconsistent with each other, then the com mon law  remedy will almost certainly have been excluded by necessary  implication.  To do otherwise would circumvent the intention  of Parliament.  A good example of this is Marci c, where a  sewerage undertaker was subject to an elaborate scheme of  statutory regulation which included an independent regulator  with powers of enforcement whose decisions were subject to  judicial review.  The statutory scheme provided a procedure for  making complaints to the regulator.  The House of Lords held  that a cause of actio n in nuisance would be inconsistent with  the statutory scheme.  It would run counter to the intention of  Parliament.    34.  The question is not whether ther e are any differences  between the common law remedy and the statutory scheme.   There may well be dif ferences.  The question is whether the  differences are so substantial that they demonstrate that  Parliament could not have intended the common law remedy to  survive the introduction of the statutory scheme.  The court  should not be too ready to find that a  common law remedy has  been displaced by a statutory one, not least because it has  always been open to Parliament to make the position clear by  stating explicitly whether the S tatute is intended to be  exhaustive.  The mere fact that there are some differen ces  between the common law and the statutory positions is unlikely  to be sufficient unless they are substantial.  The fact that the  House of Lords was divided in Total Network SL  [2008]  AC1174 shows how difficult it may sometimes be to decide on  which side  of the line a case falls.  The question is whether  looked at as a whole, a common law remedy would be  incompatible with the statutory scheme and therefore could not  have been intended to coexist with it. ”  Conclusions on Preliminary Points on Vicarious Lia bility 153. As to the first of these two preliminary points as to vicarious liability, the fact that the  Act does not provide expressly that there should be vicarious liability is of little  assistance to Morrisons: the principle expressed in Majrowski  is that t he principle of  vicarious liability is applicable where an employee commits a breach of statutory  obligations , even where they  rest on him alone,  while acting in the course of his  employment unless the S tatute expressly or impliedly indicates otherwise.   The House  rejected the submission that the principle was neutral.    154. To argue, as Ms  Proops does, that the Act imposes liability only on data controllers  and that an employee is not a person for whose torts the Act contemplates his  employer should be liable vicariously because the employer is not a relevant data  controller when the employee process es data in his own right  without a uthority, for  his own purposes , and thereby  as a data controller , and this is not therefore an  “employee’s tort”  for which the emp loyer can have secondary liability , not only run s  contrary to the views expressed in Harrison v National Coal Board  by Lord TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       McDermott, but also takes too narrow a view of the Act.  The DPA must be seen in its  full context: that it is the domestic implement ation of a European Directive which  describes itself in its title as a Directive “..on the protection of individuals with regard  to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. ”  The  emphasis is on the protection of data subjects.  I accept Mr Barnes’s submission that if,  at the moment an employee decide s to misuse data to which his employer ha s given  him access the employer cease s to be under any further liability , on the basis that  the  employee thereafter w ill be data controller i n respect of the misuse, this would tend to  defeat the rights of data subjects in respect of that data rather than enhance them  as is  the apparent purpose of the Directive.  What, to the contrary, is consistent with the  greater security and protection of t he data subject is  to impose the obligations of data  controller upon such an employee  (making him liable personally as he would not  otherwise be merely qua employee)  whilst retaining his employer’s vicarious liability  for his wrongdoings  where  it is approp riate to do so.   Two parties are then potentially  responsible in law.    155. I do not therefore conclude that because the Act has the effect that Skelton became  data controller of the informa tion he was later to disclose  it, thereby excludes  vicarious liability for his breaches of statutory duty under the DPA in respect of that  information.   156. A similar point arises in respect of  paragraph 10 of Part II of Schedule 1 to t he DPA.  Ms Proops suggests that by providing  that a data controller must take reasonable steps  to ensure the reliability of any employees of his the Act indicates that the draftsman  intends to restrict the liability of a data controller for the acts of employees, such that  an employer is liable only to tak e reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of an  employee, and no further , and that this provision thus implies an exclusion of  vicarious liability.  Mr. Barnes argues to the contrary: consistent with the overall  protective purposes of the Directive, the Act here articulates  an explicit protection ,  which is intended to supplement , not exclude , what would otherwise be liability.  In  his submission this is strengthened by the fact that in the Directive itself the obligation  to take care as to the nature of those to whom data is entrusted is mentioned in that  part which relates to the security of data: the liabilities of the data controller are  contained in a part of the Directive distinct from this.  This, he suggests, shows that  the draftsman did not intend the provision to be the sole ground on which  an employer  could be held liable for an employee, but rather intended to add a specific safeguard  for data, which would not depend on there being any infringement by the employer   concerned.   157.  Ms Proops supports her submission that , upon a proper construct ion, the DPA  impliedly excludes an employer being held liable for t he wrongs of an employee of  his, by reference to the significant costs of compliance with t he data protectio n  principles (see, for instance, Ittihadieh , paragraph 26 as to the costs of a si ngle  subject access request under the Act).  She describes them as giving rise to “enormous  and unavoidable up -front costs/burdens for data controllers ”.  To add vicarious  liability to this would be to cause already large potential liabilities to be  dispro portionately crushing in their effect. It would be in addition to “(i) the costs  which they incur  in physically processing the data (ii) any liability burden to which  they may be exposed if they breach their obligations under the DPA” (closing written  subm issions, paragraph 130(4)) , yet Morrisons qua data controller are completely TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       innocent .  It is not, she submits, in the public interest for an “excessive liability” to be  visited on an innocent data controller.  The possibility of “eye -watering liability” m ay  impose enormous pressure on a data controller to limit the presence of human agency,  even where it plays an important role in an effective and efficient operation: to do s o  is not in the public interest, and the principle of vicarious liability should b e designed  to serve the public interest.   158. These in terrorem  arguments are almost certainly overstated: I note that I have not  been referred to a single case in which it is said that vicarious liab ility had  overwhelmed a company. I have  no doubt this is beca use many commercial entities  will cover the potential losses by appropriate insurance within the ordinary course of  trading.  Further , since this is by agr eement of both C ounsel the first case in a period  of very nearly 20 years since the Act came into for ce to raise the question whether  there is vicarious liability at all under the Act for the actions of an employee in  deliberately misusing the data with which he was  entrusted , it seem s unlikely that the  Doomsday scenarios postulated by Morrisons will occu r.  This is without yet  factoring in both an absence of such cases in respect of the 1984 statutory predecessor  of the 1998 Act, and the likely relatively modest award of damages in the event of a  finding of liability: I suspect that in many cases the liab ility may be within the means  of an ordinary tortfeasor  to satisfy, but, if not, though in a group action affecting a  very large number of employees the total sum may certainly be significant , it seems  unlikely that the amounts payable would equate, for  instance, with those  that might be  contemplated in respect of a product liability claim asserted by a cohort of injured  customers.   I accept Mr Barnes ’ argument on the first preliminary point.   159. There is more to be said for the argument that Parliam ent has leg islated in the field, to  leave no space for the common law tort of misuse of private data or the equitable  action for breach of confidence.  Part of the purpose of the Directive was to achieve a  measure of harmonisation of the laws of the member states.  I t may be thought  anomalous, in the field covered by the Directive, that there remain other potential  liabilities which depend upon the application of different tests  in different  jurisdictions.  However, it must be remembered that the purpose of the Directi ve, and  therefore the Act , is to provide greater protection for the rights of data subjects. So  viewed, additional liabilities in respect of data (insofar as the Data Protection Act  creates them, over and above such liabilities as there would otherwise be in equity or  at common law) add  layer s of protection. It is generally open to a member state to  augment a minimum EU-wide standard of protection where protection is the aim .   Accordingly, thus far, I cannot conclude that the DPA excludes common law and  equitable actions in respect of the same data disclosure.   160. As for McKerr , the current case is not on all fours with it, for the Court is not being  invited to develop the common law by holding that it should move beyond its current  boundaries into an area curre ntly regulated by legislation.  Rather, the legislation was  enacted at a time when the relevant common law duties and obligations were known  to exist.  In such circumstances, if the common law were intended no longer to  operate, the expectation would be th at Parliament would say so in terms.  The  principle Lord Hoffman thought to be well established in paragraph 75 of his speech  in Rottman  is that which is in play: that a rule of common law is not extinguished by  a statute unless the statute makes it clear by express provision or by clear implication.   There is no express provision here.  Nor do I consider that an implication to that effect TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       is clear.  To the extent that the tort of misuse of private information, or an action for  breach of confidence can appl y in a field also regulated by the DPA is subject to the  principles stated by Lord Dyson JSC in The Child Poverty Action Group  case.  The  two pre -existing actions do not run counter to the tenor of the Act.  Looking at the  question as a whole, as Lord Dyso n (paragraph 34, last sentence) invites the Court to  do I could not hold the common law remedy to be incompatible with the statutory  scheme.  Both pre -existing  forms of action  seek to impose liabilities for data misuse  or the disclosure of confidential inf ormation by both penalising it and making it  possible for a court to grant injunctive relief against it.  The actions are no t so much  incompatible as comple mentary.   161. Accordingly, I reject both the preliminary arguments advanced by Ms Proops QC.   Course  of Employment   162. Ms Proops submits that the act central to liability is that of disclosure on the 12th.  January 2014.  This was not done from work, did not involve a work computer, and  was far removed in time from the act of copying the data (which I have already found  to have occurred on 18th. November).  There was thus such a degree of geographical  and temporal separation from Skelton’s employment that the act of disclosure could  not be said to have arisen in its course.  It was even done on a Sunday, when it was   common ground Skelton was not at work. Decided cases all showed a much closer  connection – in Rose v Plenty  [1976] 1 WLR 141 , CA the employee was on the job,  delivering milk; in Century Insurance Co Ltd v Northern Ireland Road  Transport Board  [1942] AC 50 9 the employee’s ac t of lighting a cigarette by  striking a match near flammable fuel came when he was transferring petrol from a  delivery lorry to a tank , a job he was tasked to do. Although the cases established that  the approach was a broad, evaluative o ne, such factors as these were of importance.  So too was the question whether the act was for the benefit of the employer, although  this was no longer a decisive test.  Nonetheless, no case had gone quite so far as to  hold an employer liable vicariously fo r an act which, far fr om being intended to  benefit an  employer was designed specifically to harm that employer : Lord Clyde in  Lister  at paragraph 44 had recognised, too, when reviewing a couple of cases in  which an empl oyee had assaulted another,  that acts  of passion, resentment or personal  spite might fall outside the scope of employment. Here, if the court upheld a plea of  vicarious liability by holding Morrisons liable to the co -employees whose personal  information had been disclosed by Skelton, the cour t would be helping Skelton  achieve what he criminally set out to do – harm Morrisons financially : it would  become a “witting instrument of the criminal”.   163. Cases such as Mattis v Pollock  [2003] EWCA Civ 887  may have involved findings  of vicarious liability f or assaults which were not committed at the workplace, nor  even immediately proximate to it in time of place,  but on proper analysis that case  was one in which the person for whose acts the employer was held liable was  employed specifically to be violent towards customers, as a bouncer, and the act of  violence he performed by knifing someone with whom he had earlier been in dispute  at the door of his employer’s night -club was a logical extension of his employment,  tightly connected to his employer’s enterp rise. Williams v Hemphill  [1966] UKHL 3  may have been a case in which the driver of a lorry  deviated from the route he was  supposed to take, but that geographical excursion from the authorised course did not  have the consequence that he ceased to be drivin g on his employer’s business – but TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       even here it was acknowledged by Lord Pearce that this had to kept within sensible  limits . To deviate by, for instance, driving from place to place in the home counties  via Inverness would on any common -sense view be so w ell outside his employment  as would mean  the driver could no longer sensibly be regarded as being in the course  of it.   164. Moreover, Ms Proops drew support from the reasoning in Credit Lyonnais v Export  Credits Guarantee Department  [2000] AC 486, in which the  House of Lords held  that an employer was not vicariously liable for acts of an employee committed in the  course of his employment which were not in themselves tortious and only became so  when linked to other acts outside the course of his employment. The issue had  correctly been identified in the Court of Appeal as:  "Where A becomes liable to B as a joint tortfeasor with C in the tort of deceit  practised by C on B on the basis that A and C have a common design to defraud  B and A renders assistance to C pur suant to and in furtherance of the common  design, does D, A's employer, become vicariously liable to B, simply because the  act of assistance, which is not itself the deceit, is in the course of A's employment  with D?"      In the case itself, Mr P (who worked  for the Defendant) had been corrupted  by bribes  from a fraudster, Mr C.  He authorised the issue of four guarantees which were an  essential part of a fraud which, by the time it occurred, P knew C was committing on  the Claimant bank. The issue of the gua rantees had in itself no adverse consequences  for the Claimant. It was not a tort. Thus P had committed no tort during the course of  his employment; what he did , viewed on its own , did not amount to the commission  of one.    165. Lord Woolf at 495 C -D said:   “The conduct for which the servant is responsible must constitute an actionable  tort and to make the employer responsible for that tort the conduct necessary to  establish the employee's liability must have occurred within the course of the  employment. If the t ort is committed jointly, then it is conduct which is within the  course of the employment sufficient to constitute the tort, irrespective of which  tortfeasor performed the acts, which is necessary. As both tortfeasors are  responsible for the tortious condu ct as a whole in the case of joint torts it is not  necessary to distinguish between the actions of the different tortfeasors. For  vicarious liability what is critical, as long as one of the joint tortfeasors is an  employee, is that the combined conduct of both tortfeasors is sufficient to  constitute a tort in the course of the employee's employment.         Were the position otherwise, you could have the extraordinary result that if an  employee carried out all the acts complained of there would be no liabili ty on the  employer, but if the acts were carried out partly by the employee and partly by a  non-employee, the employer would be liable. The obverse situation is the same. If  an employer would be liable if the employee personally took the action  complained of the situation is no different because some of the acts were done by TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       some one who was not an employee as part of a join t enterprise with the  employee.”     166. What Ms Proops drew from this was a submission that all the acts necessary for the  tort complained of  had to be committed by the employee in the course of  employment. In the present case, the most that could be said would be that some were.  That was not enough to make the employer liable on a secondary basis for those acts.   Morrisons’ submission was that  Skelton could not be acting in the course of his  employment at a time when Morrisons itself owed no duties to the Claimants in  respect of the data: Skelton alone was data controller in respect of that which he  disclosed  at the time he did so .    167. In an exte nded review of a number of the decisions which illustrate the way in which  principles of vicarious liability have been applied, or a claim for such liability  rejected, Ms Proops sought to draw a distinction between actions which pursued a  personal, indepen dent venture of the employee by contrast with those in which the  employee, though acting contrary to his employer’s wishes, and often criminally, was  nonetheless within the scope of his employment.  The question was raised whether a  tort committed against a third party (either a fellow employee or member of the  public ) whilst the allegedly tortious employee was at work fell on the personal,  independent side of the line and not on the side of  the “course of employment”.  It  was not difficult to see that if a  personal grudge, arising outside the work place,  manifested itself in a violent action inside it, where being at work was merely the  occasion for an action which might as well have happened elsewhere, it might be  expected that the court would hold the emp loyee liable on his own, and that no  secondary liability would attach to the employer.    168. In this regard, I was referred to Deatons v Flew  [1949] 79 CLR 370 (High Court of  Australia), and more significantly Irving v Post Office  [1987] IRLR 289 and  Weddall v  Barchester Healthcare  [2010] EWCA Civ 25, all cases in which the  Claimants were held to have pursued a grievance of their own, and were held not to  be acting in the course of their employment even though (in the first two cases) what  they did was at their  place of work , and during working hours .    169. In Deatons v Flew , a barmaid flung a glass at a troublesome customer, in a moment  of retributive rage.  In Irving , a postman lived next door to the claimant, with whom  he fell out.  The postman’s duties included t he sorting of mail at his depot.  Just  before Christmas, whilst sorting mail, he saw an envelope addressed to the claimant  and his wife.  Though he did not himself have the duty of delivering the mail to the  Irvings, he wrote on the back of the envelope “G o back to Jamaica sambo” (Mr Irving  was black).  He added a cartoon of a smiling mouth and eyes.  When the card was in  due course delivered, the Irvings were greatly upset by it.  They claimed that there  had been an act of discrimination against them contr ary to s1(1) of the Race Relations  Act 1976, for which the Post Office was (under th at Act) vicariously liable.  The  Court of Appeal (Fox LJ, Sheldon J) applied the dictum of Dixon J in his judgment in  the High Court of Australia when it decided that the a ct of the barmaid in Deatons   was not an act in the course of her employment:  TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       “The truth is that it was an act of passion and resentment done  neither in furtherance of the master’s interests nor under his  express and implied authority nor as an incident to  or in  consequence of anything the barmaid was employed to do.  It  was a spontaneous act of retributive justice.  The occasion for  administering it and the form it took may have arisen from the  fact that she was a barmaid, but retribution was not within th e  scope of her employment as a barmaid.”   170. As to Weddall  (on which Ms Proops placed most emphasis : the other two cases were  both decided before the decision in Lister ) the facts were that Weddall was the deputy  manager of a care home.  A senior health assist ant, Marsh, worked under him.  They  did not get on particularly well.  One of the nightshift employees called in sick on a  September evening in 2006.  In accordance with his duty to secure a replacement,  Weddall phoned round to see if an employee could be found to fill the gap.  He called  Marsh at his home.  Marsh was free either to accept or refuse the offer of a voluntary  extra shift.  He had had a bad day, because of a row at home, and by 6pm was very  drunk.  He did not react well to the call from Weddal l, forming the impression that the  latter was mocking him because of his drunken state.  Shortly afterwards, he rang the  home saying he wished to resign, rode to it on his bicycle, saw Weddall sitting in the  garden at the front of the home, and subjected h im to an unprovoked, very violent,  attack.  The first instance judge concluded that Marsh was acting personally for his  own reasons, in his own context and on the basis of his own passions and feelings;  that an employer was not to be held vicariously liabl e for every act that one person  might commit against another occasioned by or growing from their employment, but  not otherwise sufficiently specifically connected with it: it would be neither fair nor  just to hold the employer of Marsh (and Weddall) vicari ously liable for the acts Marsh  had committed.  The Court of Appeal had no difficulty in concluding that the judge  had reached the right conclusion for the right reasons.   171. Here, Ms  Proops submitted that Skelton’s act in posting employee data on the web  was similar to the act of Weddall. It was a personal action, taken for his own reasons,  by way of retribution.    172. In contrast, I was referred to cases which went the other way. In Bernard v Attorney  General of Jamaica [2004] UKPC 47, a police constable had dema nded the use of a  telephone from the claimant, who had been in a queue and had just begun to make a  call.  It was within the scope of the police officer’s duty to demand the use of a  telephone as a matter of urgency if necessity arose.  When the claimant r efused, an  altercation broke out, ending when the police officer drew a gun and shot the claimant  at point blank range, causing him severe injury.  A judge in Jamaica upheld a claim  against the police force.  In turn, the latter’s appeal to the Court of Ap peal in Jamaica  was upheld.  However, the Privy Council quashed the Court of Appeal’s decision and  restored the judgment of the trial judge.  It did so by applying the principle in Lister ,  which it plainly considered signalled a change of approach . The pol ice officer had  purportedly asserted police authority, immediately before the shooting incident, when  seeking priority in the queue for the phone, and it was the fact that the plaintiff was  not prepared to yield to this which led to the shooting.  Evidence  of the constable’s  later actions in arresting the plaintiff in hospital for interfering with his duties TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       supported this analysis.  Moreover, the State had created the risks inherent in  permitting constables to take loaded service revolvers home.   173.  The Priv y Council reached a further decision to much the same effect in Brown v  Robinson  [2004] UKPC 56 , another case of a policeman using firearms in public,  when at a football match he was trying to restrain an  unruly crowd, when the  deceased , Reid , assaulted hi m and ran  off.  The policeman  then set off in hot pursuit  down the road. He asked Reid if he wanted the policeman to shoot him; and, feeling   he ought to be taught a lesson  did just that and exacted swift retribution for Reid's  earlier behaviour .  He was se eking to  impose a general deterrence and his authority,  so that thereafter good order would prevail.  It was not a case where there was a  private act of revenge unconnected with his employment.   174.  In Fennelly v Connex Southeastern Limited  [2000] EWCA Civ 5568  a ticket  inspector assaulted a passenger.  The passenger had passed through a ticket barrier  where the inspector was checking tickets: as he went on, the inspector called after him  “Where is your ticket?” but the claimant walked on further.  The inspector  followed,  and a heated exchange took place.  The ticket was snatched from the passenger by the  inspector and returned: but immediately afterwards the inspector put the passenger in  a headlock and dragged him down a couple of steps or two, that being the a ssault.  A  first instance decision on these facts rejecting the claim that there was no vicarious  liability, because this act was outside the scope of employment, was reversed on  appeal.    175. Mr Barnes also sought to rely on Axon v Ministry of Defence  [2016] EWHC 787  (QB) .  The captain of a royal naval frigate was relieved of his command, following  allegations against him of bullying behaviour. Three articles were published in the  Sun about this, leading to further coverage in the wider media.  The Sun disclose d that  it had had a source within the Ministry  of Defence ('MOD') who had been providing  information for some 8 years and who had, over that time, rec eived a total of about  £100,000, who had given it the information. She was criminally charged, and  sentenc ed to imprisonment as a result.  In an action the Claimant asserted that he had  a  reasonable expectation of privacy and/or confidentiality in connection with the fact s  that members of his crew h ad complained about him, that an Equal Opportunities  Investigat ion (EOI) ha d been carried out into his conduct , that he had been ordered to  leave the Ship whilst it was in Gibraltar and to return to the UK , and as to the  outcome of the EOI .  Nicol J  decided the case against the captain on the basis that he  did not hav e any such  reasonable expectation of privacy, but went on to consider the  rival arguments whether – if he had found that there was liability – the Ministry  would be vicariously liable for the acts of the source.    176. In determining this issue, he took the broad approach to the nature of the job of the  primary tortfeasor as advocated in Mohamud . The source had  worked in a security  sensitive environment. She had Developed Vetting  clearance which allowed her to  have access to informatio n up to the Top Secret classification. With this came  obligations. She:  “..had signed documentation which reminded her of her obligation to  maintain confidentiality in information whose disclosure had not been  authorised. For someone who occupied such a se nsitive position it is in my  judgment appropriate to view  her job as including the task to preserve that TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       confidentiality. …….  she must have learned of that information in the  course of her work. I can see no other way that it co uld have reached  her….Of course, for the purpose of examining this issue, I must assume  (contrary to my earlier finding) that Ms Jordan -Barber's disclosure to Mr  Kay was actionable at the suit of the Claimant. It is only if she committed a  tort against him  that any issue of vicarious  liability could arise. But if that  was the case, there is a clear and obvious connect ion between that wrong  and that part of her job which required her to keep such information  confidential.  If this was the case, then it would seem to me to be just to  require the MOD to assume vicarious  responsibility. This is not simply an  example of the  employment being the opportunity for the wrong to be  committed. As part of her work, she needed to have access to security  sensitive and confidential information. As part of her work she shared  office space with the J9 Pol/Ops PJOBS team and was likely to  learn other  information in consequence. There is always an inherent risk that those  entrusted with such information will abuse the trust reposed in them, but  rather than this being a reason why vicarious  liability should not be  imposed, I think, on the co ntrary, it is a reason in its favour. True it is that  Ms Jordan -Barber's activity did nothing to further the MOD's aims, it was  carried on without their knowledge, and it received no encouragement from  the MOD. What she did was prohibited. However, those f eatures do not  preclude vicarious  liability (and [counsel for the Ministry]  did not suggest  they did). Notwithstanding them, if I had held that [the source]  had  committed a tort (contrary to my findings), I would have concluded that that  hypothetical tort would have been sufficiently closely connected with her  job for it to be just for the MOD to be  vicariously  liable. ”  177. This was the only case to which I was referred in which vicarious liability for a breach  of confidentiality/data leak had been considered.  Ms Proops submitted that the obite r  comments could not be relied on.  They rested on a misconceived notion that merely  because an employee received or gained access to data in the course of employment  this automatically meant that their wrongful disclosur e of that data had to be treated as  undertaken in the course of their employment irrespective of the actual circumstances.   She described this as a “reductionist, decontextualised approach to secondary  liability” which was “impermissible in view of the mul tifactorial analysis which is  required in the context of the application of the doctrine of secondary liability ”.    Discussion   178. In summary, Ms  Proops takes seven main points, as well as rejecting the approach  taken by Nicol J in Axon .  First, she submits th at the act of posting the data to the web  was temporally and physically disengaged from the time when the data was copied by  Skelton, and was placed on the web at a time when Skelton was not at work.  Second,  she submit s that at the time he did so, Morriso ns were not data controllers within the  meaning of the Data Protection Act in respect of the payroll data disclosed.  They were  not “on the field”.  Similarly, third, adopting Credit Lyonnais , all the aspects of the tort  had to be within the course of empl oyment and here they were not.  Fourth, the act was  motivated by a grudge, and cases such as Deatons , Irving  and Weddall  showed that  this was a significant factor to take into account.  Fifth, in Bernard v Attorney  General of Jamaica,  the Privy Council had  emphasised that because vicarious liability TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       is strictly to be applied, it should not easily be extendable: to hold Morrisons liable here  would be such a n extension, and impermissible.  Sixth, to find in favour of Morrisons  would amount to the court facilit ating a criminal’s objective in harming his employer,  which the court should set its face against.   179. Seven th, she submits that if the principles articulated by Lord Phillips at paragraph 35  of his judgment in the Catholic Child Welfare Society  case were cons idered, they  indicated an answer favourable to Morrisons. He said:    “The relationship that gives  rise to vicarious liability is in the vast majority of  cases that of employer and employee under a contract of employment. The  employer will be vicariously lia ble when the employee commits a tort in the  course of his employment. There is no difficulty in identifying a number of  policy reasons that usually make it fair, just and reasonable to impose  vicarious liability on the employer when these criteria are sati sfied: i) The  employer is more likely to have the means to compensate the victim than  the employee and can be expected to have insured against that liability;  ii)  The tort will have been committed as a result of activity being taken by the  employee on beha lf of the employer;  iii) The employee's activity is likely to  be part of the business activity of the employer;  iv) The employer, by  employing the employee to carry on the activity will have created the risk  of the tort committed by the employee;  v) The em ployee will, to a greater or  lesser degree, have been under the control of the employer. ”  180. Ms Proops submitted that this was not a case of a single claimant, but of several who  together mounted a considerable financial challenge, such that criterion (i) was  of  little weight – possibly all very w ell where risks were physical or  material in nature,  but far more wide -reaching when dealing with data, which was neither; criterion (ii)  was inapplicable, since Skelton’s activity was not on behalf of his employer bu t the  opposite; as to criterion (iii) Skelton’s actions were not part of Morrisons’ business  activity – Morrisons had left the field; as to (iv) Morrisons did  not employ Skelton to  carry on that activity, which was not part of his core duties; and criteri on (v) was of  little weight these days.   181.  These points have considerable weight. However, it is rightly agreed between the  parties that my task is evaluative, giving such weight to the various factors identified  in principle by the courts as the facts of th e case require. Illustrative cases do not  provide any more than indicative help: interesting as were the cases to which I was  referred in respect of grievances, the decision in each was heavily fact -sensitive.   182. Four particular findings of fact are of import ance.   183. First, I reject Ms Proop s’ argument that the disclosure on the web of the payroll data  was disconnected by time, place and nature from Skelton’s employment. I find, rather,  that as Mr Barnes submitted there was a n unbroken  thread that linked his wor k to the  disclosure: what happened was a seamless and continuous sequence of events. My  reasons for this are first that in October, prior to knowing he was again to be a conduit  for payroll data between PeopleSoft and KPMG, Skelton showed signs of interest  in  the TOR network. When he knew (on 1st. November) that he was indeed to be the go - between, he obtained the mobile phone he was later to use just for making the  criminal disclosures. He brought in a personal USB stick to work and copied payroll TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       informati on to it in mid -November. Lying low for a while after that was necessary to  create an appearance of separation and to avoid suspicion falling on him too readily.  He again investigated TOR in December; adopted the user name and date of birth of a  colleague to draw the blame onto him  when setting up an account from which to  upload the payroll data to the web ; sent data to a web -sharing web -site in January, and  either because that did not excite any great immediate interest, or because he had  planned in advanc e to cause the maximum embarrassment to Morrisons immediately  prior to the announcement of their financial results, sent the anonymous letter s he did  to three newspapers in March 2014. These actions were in my view all part of a plan,  as the research and c areful attempts to hide his tracks indicate. As I have already  noted (para. 22 above) this is precisely the same view as that taken by HHJ Thomas  QC when sentencing Skelton. This was no sequence of random events, but an  unbroken chain beginning even before , but including, the first unlawful act of  downloading data from his personal work computer to a personal USB stick.   184. Second, I find that Morrisons deliberately entrusted Skelton with the payroll data.  It  was not merely something to which work gave him acc ess: dealing with the data was  a task specifically assigned to him. Associated with this, I find that in his role with  Morrisons, day in and day out, he was in receipt of information which was  confidential or to have limited circulation only: and he was ap pointed on the basis that  this would happen, and he could be trusted to deal with it safely.  Morrisons took the  risk they might be wrong in placing the trust in him.   185. Third, his role in respect of the payroll data was to receive and store it, and to disclo se  it to a third party. That in essence was his task, so far as the payroll data went: the fact  that he chose to disclose it to others than KPMG was not authorised, but it was  nonetheless closely related to what he was tasked to do.   186.  Fourth, i t follows fro m these findings that when Skelton received the data, though  covertly intending to copy it for misuse, he was acting as an employee, and that the  chain of events from then until disclosure was unbroken. The fact that the disclosures  of 12th. January were m ade from home, by use of his personal equipment, on a Sunday  did not disengage them from  his employment .  187. The argument that Morrisons were not “on the field” since they were no longer data  controller in respect of such data as was copied by Skelton is mispl aced. In part it  repeats the argument I have already rejected at paragraph s 153 -155 above. The  question is not whether Morrisons did wrong, but whether , when Skelton did , his acts  were closely connected with his employment.   188. The argument based on Credit Lyo nnais  does not assist Morrisons either . First, it  assumes that there was no unbroken sequence of events, but the converse. Second, the  issue in that case was very different from the issue here. It was not whether the acts  complained of fell within the cour se of employment but rather  whether acts which  were committed within the course of employment, which were not in themselves  tortious, could be aggregated with acts of another party so as to render the employee a  joint tortfeasor with that party, for whose joint acts the employer would be held  vicariously liable.    189.  As to the act being one of “retributive justice” as Dixon J. would have termed it,  arising out of a grudge, it must be remembered that in Mohamu d Lord Toulson noted TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       that the motive of the employee  was beside the point  (paragraph 48) . Quite apart from  being of the highest authority, this must be right – for the criminal motive of the  thieving employee  in Morris v Martin , or the deliberate dishonesty of the clerk in  Lloyd v Grace Smith  did not c onver t an act from one in respe ct of which there would  have been vicarious liability into one in respect of which there would not.   Earlier in  his judgment, too, and consistently with the broad view of course of employment  which he espoused, Lord Toulson expres sed considerable reservations as to the justice  of the result in Deatons v Flew  (see his paragraph 30).  Viewed broadly, the  significance of a personal grudge may be, as it were, to bring into the work  environment factors which belong elsewhere, so as to ma ke it clear that the only  relationship between the tort and work is that the workplace happens to be where it is  committed, when it might just as well have been elsewhere. That does not apply here  where the grudge was work -related, the central relationship  with which it was  concerned was that of Skelton with his employer, and its commission was entirely  depende nt upon the field of activities a ssigned to him by that employer.   190. Ms Proop s’ fifth point has limited purchase: though it is true that vicarious liab ility  for the unlawful disclosure of data has only once been considered in any case to  which I was referred (that of Axon ) the principles do not depend centrally on the  subject matter of the wrong: it is counter -intuitive to suppose that where the field of   activity assigned to an employee concern ed anything other than data, that employee  would be said to be acting within the course of his employment where, in identical  circumstances, save that the field of activity now concerned data, he would not.   191. Ms Proop s’ sixth line of argument has more traction. Until relatively recently in the  history of evolution of vicarious liability the fact that an act was done for the  employer’s benefit, albeit not as the employer instructed or would have wished, was  highly mater ial to a conclusion that the act was within the course of employment.   Employment brings with it a duty of loyalty on the servant’s part co -relative to the  duty of good faith of the master’s side. Though benefit is no longer critical, it remains  of importa nce in evaluating whether the relevant tortious act fell within the course of  employment. The act here was taken deliberately to harm, rather than benefit,  Morrisons. In contractual terms it was a repudiation of the contract of employment.    192. That said, Morrisons were not the only victims. T he action here is brought not by  Morrisons but by Skelton’s fellow employees. They claim not for the harm done to  Morrisons, but that aimed at them. Trampling on their rights to the privacy (or  confidentiality) of the dat a was a deliberate  act by Skelton . A principal aim may have  been to hurt Morrisons, but the method, and it may be an aim as well, was harming  their interests. The cases show, too, that  the actions of housemasters in abusing  children they were employed to c are for, of priests in attacking vulnerable victims, of  solicitor’s clerks in defrauding clients of the firm, or apprentice cleaners in stealing  customer’s clothing w ere also repudiatory, and always liable to do serious damage to  their employers’ business,  reputations, liv elihood and continued viability, yet in each  of these cases vicarious liability has been established.   The issue is not so much at  whom the conduct was aimed, but rather  upon whose shoulders it is just for the loss to  fall: the approach si nce Bazley v Curry  and Lister  as developed in Mohamud   emphasises taking a broad view of the scope of employment, and it is notable that  Lord Toulson explained those cases in which liability had been upheld as being those  where the employee misused his posi tion in a way which injured the claimant, and TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       that it was just that the employer who selected him and put him in that position should  be held responsible. He was putting great weight on “enterprise risk”.  I would add to  his exposition only that the employ er, too, had at least the theoretical right to control.  Though employers can hardly tell highly skilled workers the detail of how to do their  jobs, it remains a necessary element in every contract of employment that the  employer has “…lawful authority to c ommand so far as there is scope for it. and there  must always be some room for it, if only in i ncidental or collateral matters " (Zuijs v.  Wirth Brothers Proprietary, Ltd  (1955) 93 C.L.R. 561, 571 , cited by McKenna J.  in Ready -Mixed Concrete v Minister of P ensions and National Insurance  [1968]  2 QB 497 ): nowadays perhaps best rendered as a directory power.  An employer, in  general, remains responsible for what work is done, where and when, under what  systems and with what equipment, and who the clients or cu stomers are to be.  The  employer could theoretically place a would -be tortfeasor who is an employee in a  position where he could not  so easily commit the tort, and design systems to prevent  it occurring which the employee could be directed to observe.   193. The factors identified in Catholic Child Welfare Society  are typically true of  relationships of employee and employer, which was what was address ed in paragraph  35 of the judgment of Lord Phillips.   They are true here too , where the context is not  relationship  but course of employment : Morrisons are  more likely to have the means  to compensate the victim than Skelton and can be expected to have insured against  that liability , even if breaches of data security may not historically have been a  mainstream risk ; it follows from my finding above (ii) that t he tort was committed as  a result of activity being taken by the employee on behalf of the employer  – in the  sense of his being chosen to handle the data, with a view to the employer’s interests in  completing an aud it, such that Skelton’s  employee activity – viewed broadly – can be  seen as  part of the business activity of the employe e, even though he chose to abuse  his position. As to (iv), t he employer, by employing the employee to carry on the  activity , created the  risk of the tort committed by the employee; and v) Skelton was ,  to a gre ater or lesser degree,  under the control of the employer , at least in the sense   described in the last paragraph above .  194.  Adopting the broad and evaluative approach encouraged by Lord T oulson in  Mohamud, I have therefore come to the conclusion that there is a sufficient  connection between the position in which Skelton  was employed and his wrongful  conduct , put into the position of handling and disclosing the data as he was by  Morrisons ( albeit it was meant to be to KPMG alone) ,  to make it right for Morrisons   to be held liable “under the principle of social justice which can be traced  back to Holt  CJ”.  This conclusion would be the same irrespective of whether a breach of duty  under the D PA, a misuse of private information, or a breach of the duty of confidence  was concerned, for the essential actions constituting a legal wrong in each case were  the same.   195. I am fortified in this conclusion by  the views expressed by Nicol J  in Axon : though  insofar as he based his decision upon a view of the source’s job as including the task  to preserve confidentiality , since she had an obligation to keep matters confidential, I  have doubts as to its correctness: where the issue is  the identification of the field of  activities of an employee, this is  not necessarily to be answered by identifying the  obligations that are an adjunct to those activities, and are not activities in themselves,  which do not in themselves  constitute duties  specifically entrusted to the employee in TH E HO NOURABLE MR JUSTICE LANGSTAFF   Approv ed Judgment       question.  Mr Barnes placed some emphasis, in his submissions, on the role of Skelton  as being to preserve confidentiality: for the same reason as gives me doubt about this  part of Nicol J’s judgment, I have place d no weight on this. His role was to handle the  payroll data, receiving it, storing it for a while, transferring it to others and then  deleting it. All bar the last he did: that is sufficient to draw a close link with his  employment, within the principles set out in Mohamud and exemplified in case law,   and although Morrisons were one target of his actions it is in my view just that they  should be liable vicariously for the wrongs Skelton did to the claimants .  Conclusions : Summary   196.  In conclusion, I hold that  the DPA does not impose primary liability upon   Morrisons; that Morrisons have not been proved to be at fault by breaking any of the  data protection principles, save in one respect which was not causative of any loss;  and that neither primary liability fo r misuse of private information nor breach of  confidentiality can be established.   197. I reject, however, the arguments that the DPA upon a proper interpretation is such that  no vicarious liability can be established, and that its terms are such as to exclude  vicarious liability even in respect of actions for misuse of private information or  breach of confidentiality. Having rejected them, I hold that, applying Mohamud   principles, secondary (vicarious) liability is established.   198. The point which most troubled me in reaching these conclusions was the submission  that the wrongful acts of Skelton were deliberately aimed at the party whom the  claimants seek to hold responsible, such that to reach the conclusion I have may seem  to render the court an accessory in furth ering his criminal aims. I grant leave to  Morrisons to appeal my conclusion as to vicarious liability, should they wish to do so,  so that a higher court may consider it: but would not, without further persuasion, grant  permission to cross -appeal my conclus ions as to primary liability.
